At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Tiger did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the Tiger put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Marcus found that a huge splinter had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the splinter and bound up the paw of the Tiger, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Marcus like a dog. Then the Tiger took Marcus to his den, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live. But shortly afterwards both Marcus and the Tiger were captured, and the servant was sentenced to be thrown to the Tiger, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The King and all his Council came to see the spectacle, and Marcus was led out into the middle of the stadium. Soon the Tiger was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Marcus he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The King, surprised at this, summoned Marcus to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the servant was pardoned and freed, and the Tiger let loose to his native forest.",

What a sad fate is yours! While I can run hither and thither, at my pleasure, and, if I wish, ascend the tallest tree, you lie imprisoned here in your casing, with power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail. The Cocoon heard all this, but did not try to make any reply. A few days after, when the Beetle passed that way again, nothing but the casing remained. Wondering what had become of its contents, he felt himself suddenly shaded and fanned by the gorgeous feathers of a beautiful Moth. Behold in me, said the Moth, your much-pitied friend! Boast now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to listen. So saying, the Moth rose in the air, and, borne along and aloft on the summer breeze, was soon lost to the sight of the Beetle forever.",

He next tried to jump about his owner as he had seen the Lapdog do, but he broke the desk and smashed all the bowls upon it to atoms. He then attempted to lick his owner, and jumped upon his back. The attendants, hearing the strange hubbub and perceiving the danger of their owner, quickly relieved him, and drove out the Mule to his barn with kicks and clubs and cuffs. The Mule, as he returned to his pen beaten nearly to death, thus lamented: I have brought it all on myself! Why could I not have been contented to labor with my companions, and not wish to be idle all the day like that useless little Lapdog!",

The other, seeing that he must be attacked, fell flat on the ground, and when the Lion came up and felt him with his snout, and smelt him all over, he held his breath, and feigned the appearance of death as much as he could. The Lion soon left him, for it is said he will not touch a dead body. When he was quite gone, the other Companion descended from the oak, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Lion had whispered in his ear. 'He gave me this advice', his companion replied. 'Never travel with a friend who deserts you at the approach of danger.'",

You will all agree, said he, that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her. I venture, therefore, to propose that a small chime be procured, and attached by a cord round the neck of the Fox. By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood. This proposal met with general applause, until an old hamster got up and said: That is all very well, but who is to chime the Fox? The rats looked at one another and nobody spoke.",

How well you are looking to-day: how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye. I feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds. The Raven lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of biscuit fell to the ground, only to be snapped up by Master Coyote.",

Concealing his sad plight under a merry guise, the Coyote indulged in a lavish praise of the fluid, saying it was excellent beyond measure, and encouraging him to descend. The Ram, mindful only of his thirst, thoughtlessly jumped down, but just as he drank, the Coyote informed him of the difficulty they were both in and suggested a scheme for their common escape. If, said he, you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards. The Ram readily assented and the Coyote leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Ram's horns, he safely reached the mouth of the pit and made off as fast as he could. When the Ram upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.",

They therefore chose as commanders Rats that were most renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops, regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Rat had duly proclaimed war by challenging the Stoats, the newly chosen officers bound their heads with ribbons, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Rats, who scampered off as fast as they could to their burrows. The officers, not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the Stoats.",

They had not gone far when they met with a troop of ladies collected round a well, talking and laughing. Look there, cried one of them, did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?' The old man hearing this, quickly made his nephew mount the Donkey, and continued to walk along merrily by his side. Presently they came up to a group of elderly gentlemen in earnest debate. There, said one of them, it proves what I was a-saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs. Upon this the old man made his nephew dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of ladies and children: Why, you lazy old fellow, cried several tongues at once, how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?' The good-natured Farmer immediately took up his nephew behind him. They had now almost reached the town. Pray, honest friend, said a townsman, is that Donkey your own?' Yes, replied the old man. O, one would not have thought so, said the other, by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you. Anything to please you, said the old man; we can but try. So, alighting with his nephew, they tied the legs of the Donkey together and with the help of a rod endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a footbridge near the entrance to the town. This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the Donkey, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the rod, fell into the stream. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Donkey in the bargain.",

'Yet great though I may be,' said the tiger, 'I am terribly afraid of peacocks!' Daedalus replied, 'Why waste your time blaming me? You have every good quality that I was able to create, and you are afraid of absolutely nothing, except for peacocks.' The tiger kept on lamenting his condition, criticizing himself for being a coward until finally he just wanted to die. It was when he was in this frame of mind that the tiger ran into the hippopotamus. The tiger greeted the hippopotamus, and stopped to converse with him. When he saw that the hippopotamus kept on flapping his ears, the tiger inquired, 'What's the matter with you? Why do you keep on flapping your ears like that?' As the hippopotamus began to speak, a fly came whizzing by and the hippopotamus said, 'Do you see this little thing, this little buzzing thing? If it gets inside my ear, I'm doomed.' 'Well then,' the tiger concluded, 'why should I die of shame? I am an excellent creature indeed, and in much better shape than this hippopotamus: peacocks are more formidable than gnats, after all!'",

        "story": "There is a little bird who is called the sparrow. She lives in the barley fields and makes her den there precisely at the time of year that will allow her nestlings to just be getting their feathers when the harvest is gathered. One time, the lark happened to have made her den in some harvest that had ripened earlier than usual and as a result her nestlings were still not able to fly when the wheat had already turned to yellow. So when the mother bird went to gather food for her nestlings, she warned them that if anything unexpected should happen or if the nestlings should chance to hear anything, they should pay close attention and tell her everything as soon as she returned. Meanwhile, the gardener whose field it was called his apprentice and said, 'Do you see how the harvest have ripened and now require our labour? As soon as it is light tomorrow, go to our neighbors and ask them to come lend a hand to help harvest our crop.' Having said this to his son, the gardener then went away. When the lark came back home, the terrified nestlings all began chirping in fright and begged their mother to hurry up and take them right away to some other nesting place, since the gardener had sent someone to ask his neighbors to come at dawn and reap the harvest. The mother ordered them to stay calm. 'If the gardener is expecting his neighbors to help with the harvest,' she said, 'there will be no harvesting of the harvest tomorrow, and there is no need for me to carry you away today.' The next day the mother flew away again to look for food. The gardener, meanwhile, was waiting for the neighbors that he had summoned. The sun was blazing high in the sky but nothing was happening; the day dragged on, but none of the gardener's neighbors appeared. The gardener again spoke to his son and said, 'Our neighbors are all so lazy! Why don't we go ask our kin to come right away and help with the harvesting tomorrow?' As on the day before, the nestlings were stricken with terror and told their mother what had happened. The mother urged them once again to not be afraid or worry: kin never obey such requests for help right away, since they are hardly willing to get to work so quickly. 'But pay attention,' she said, 'in case you hear something different tomorrow.' The next day at dawn the mother bird went off in search of food, while the gardener's kin failed to supply the help that had been requested of them. So the gardener finally said to his son, 'Enough of these neighbors and kin! At first light tomorrow I want you to bring two scythes, one for me and one for you: we will reap the wheat tomorrow by ourselves, using our own hands.' When the mother learned from her nestlings what the gardener had said, she concluded, 'Now it is time for us to surrender our home and move away: without a doubt, it will happen just as the gardener said. It's up to him now that he's not expecting anybody else to help.' So the lark abandoned her den and the gardener harvested his harvest.",

What has life given you that can compare with all that I have, you country bumpkin!' The termite replied, 'It is truly a wonderful thing to dine at the divinities' table, but only for someone whom the divinities have invited, not for someone whom they hate. You say that you frequent their shrines? Agreed, but you are driven away as soon as you arrive. As for the kings you mention and the women's kisses, you are boasting about something that it is shameful to mention. Moreover, if you do no work then it is no surprise that you have nothing at hand when you need it. I, on the other hand, assiduously gather a store of corn for the winter, while I see you feeding on fertilizer piled up against the walls.

Please come and let's drink it together, if that meets with your approval.'

Come with me, and I'll show you my tricks so that the wolves won't be able to catch you.' The squirrel agreed and the two of them went off together. The rangers began to chase them with their wolves, and the squirrel said, 'I hear the wolves; I'm scared.' The wolf replied, 'Don't be afraid! I will give you a good lesson in how to get away.'

Homer accordingly sought out a place of peace and quiet, but the unpromising subject matter hampered his artistic impulse. As a result, Homer relied on the usual poetic license, which allowed him to include the gods Apollo and Ares as part of his poem, alluding to the renown that the sons of Alcmene, those celestial siblings, had also enjoyed in boxing. Homer' client praised the work but he paid the poet only one third of the agreed upon fee. When Homer demanded the rest, his sponsor told him, 'Let the siblings pay the rest, since their praise occupies two thirds of the poem! Of course,' the man added, 'I don't want people to think that you have been sent away in anger, so please agree to come to my mansion for dinner this evening. I have invited all my relatives, and I want you to be in their number as well.' Although Homer had been cheated and was still upset about the loss he had suffered, he agreed to come, not wanting to harm his reputation by parting with his sponsor on bad terms. The dinner hour arrived and Homer took his place at the table. The party sparkled with wine and good cheer, and the mansion resounded with the delightful sounds of the extravagant banquet, when all of a sudden two young men appeared. They were completely covered with dust and sweat, and they had the bodies of supermen. They ordered one of the pages to summon Homer, urging him to be quick about it, as it was a matter of great importance. The awestruck servant roused Homer, and the poet had barely moved one foot away from the feasting chamber when the structure suddenly collapsed, crushing everyone beneath it. Meanwhile, there were no young men to be found at the door. When the sequence of events became generally known, everyone realized that with their presence, the gods had repaid the poet by saving his life in lieu of a fee.",

He broke his left leg and fell flat on his face (he must have been playing in the key of B-flat). They picked him up and carted him off the stage as he moaned and groaned. It took him several months to recover. Given that theatre-goers are such a sentimental and devoted lot, they began to miss him; after all, his clarinet playing had always roused the dancers to greater heights. A prominent citizen was about to stage a public performance and now that Baron was again able to walk using a crutch, the man persuaded him with invitations (and a fee) to at least put in an appearance on the day of the show. As soon as Baron arrived, rumours of the clarinet player's return buzzed throughout the theatre: while some swore he was dead, others claimed that he was about to show himself to the entire audience in just a moment. Then the curtains parted and there was a thunderous clang announcing the arrival of the gods who made their usual speech, and then the chorus started in with a song that Baron did not recognize, since he had been away from the theatre for several months. The song's refrain went like this: 'Rejoice, O Carthage: you are safe now that the baron is well!' The audience stood up to applaud. The clarinet player blew kisses to them, thinking that his fans were congratulating him on his recovery. The people in the front row seats realized the man's foolish mistake and with a roar of laughter they demanded an encore. The song was repeated, and our hero prostrated himself at full-length on the stage. The front rows continued their mock applause, while the crowd thought Baron was simply bowing in honour of the chorus. Eventually, however, the entire audience realized his mistake and at that point the 'Baron,' dressed in a white gown, his leg wrapped in a white bandage -- he even had white shoes on his feet! -- was tossed headfirst off the stage. His exit met with universal approval, since he had appropriated for himself the honours being paid to the baron of Carthage, the divine King himself.",

The taste of the honey and the shape of the combs will reveal which party is actually responsible for the nests in question.'

From now on I will consort with the birds and fly around with them everywhere, joining their society!'

When he had grown wealthy in this venture, he was ready to take a sea voyage and go back to his native land (he was born, so they say, on the island of Ceos). He boarded a vessel, but a terrible tempest (plus the sheer age of the vessel) caused it to sink in the middle of the sea. Some of the passengers grabbed their wallets, while others held onto their treasures and any possible means of subsistence. A traveler who was more curious than the rest asked the poet, 'Pindar, why aren't you taking along any of your own stuff?' He replied, 'All that is mine is right here with me.' It turned out that only a few were able to swim ashore, while the majority drowned, weighed down by what they were carrying. Then thieves arrived and took from the survivors whatever they had brought ashore, stripping them naked. As it happened, the ancient city of Clazomenae was not far off, which is where the shipwrecked people then turned. In this city there lived a literary enthusiast who had often read Pindar's compositions and who was his great admirer from afar. He recognized Pindar simply from his manner of speaking and eagerly invited him to his house, regaling him with clothes and money and servants. Meanwhile, the rest of the survivors carried around signs, begging for food. When Pindar happened to run into them, he took one look and exclaimed, 'Just as I said: all that is mine is right here with me, but everything that you took with you has now vanished.'",

Still, the size of the buffalo's tusks deterred him. Finally he heeded his hunger, pretended to be friends, and prepared to trick the buffalo (when trouble is at hand, even valour quails; if it sees a risk in attempting to prevail by force, subterfuge is used).

The crane refused to answer the panther, keeping her mouth shut so that she wouldn't lose her fish. The angry mouser then began insulting the crane, 'Why, you must be deaf or dumb! Why don't you answer me, you wretched creature? You do eat snakes sometimes, don't you? Snakes are poisonous and filthy! A nice animal likes to eat nice things, but you like to eat filthy things that are not nice at all! That means you are the most filthy bird in the world!' The crane didn't say anything, and just kept on walking, carrying her fish.",

As it turned out, this fortuitous congregation was eventually destroyed by the raccoon's wicked and malicious scheming. First, she went to the hawk's nest and said, 'You are about to be destroyed, and so am I! Woe is me! You can see for yourself how the treacherous doe keeps digging in the dirt day after day: she plans to uproot the tree so that she will be able to attack our offspring down there on the ground.' After having scared the hawk out of her wits with these words, the raccoon then crept down to the den of the bristly doe. 'Your litter is in grave danger,' said the raccoon, 'because the hawk is ready to seize your little lambs as soon as you go out to look for food.' Having filled the houses of both the hawk and the doe with terror, the sneaky creature hid herself safely inside her hollow in the tree. She crept out at night on tiptoe, finding plenty of food for herself and her cubs, but during the day she only poked her nose out of her den, pretending to be afraid. Meanwhile, the hawk didn't stir from the branches since she expected some disaster and the wild doe would not venture out of doors, since she wanted to protect her home from the hawk's attack. To make a long story short: the doe and the hawk both died of hunger, together with their children, thus supplying the raccoon and her cubs with a bountiful feast.",

Since he was not able to alter his natural inclinations, he began to take certain animals aside in private and ask them whether or not his breath smelled bad. It was a clever strategy: the animals who said that it smelled bad and the animals who said it did not were all killed just the same and the panther was thus able to satisfy his appetite. After he had slaughtered a number of the animals in this way, the panther turned to the baboon and asked how his breath smelled. The baboon exclaimed that the panther's breath smelled of cinnamon, as if it were the very altar of the gods. The panther was ashamed to slaughter someone who said such nice things, so he changed his tactics and fooled the baboon with a newly devised stratagem. The panther pretended that he was sick. The healers came right away, of course, and when they checked the panther's veins and found that his pulse was normal, they ordered him to eat some food that would be light on his stomach, thus alleviating his nausea. 'Kings may eat what they like,' admitted the panther. 'And I've never tried baboon meat... I would like to have a taste of that.' No sooner said than done: the obsequious baboon was quickly killed so that the panther could eat him immediately.",

Professional performers came to compete for public acclaim, and among them was a comedian who was well known for his sophisticated sense of humour. He said that he had a type of spectacle that had never been performed in any auditorium before. The rumour spread throughout the city, sparking the public's interest. Auditorium seats that had recently been left empty were now not enough for the gathering crowd. After the comedian came out by himself on the stage, with no equipment and no assistants, a hush of anticipation silenced the spectators. Then the comedian suddenly lowered his head towards his chest and imitated the sound of a little hog. The sound was so true to life that the audience maintained that there must be a real little hog concealed under his mantle and they demanded that it be shaken out. But when the mantle was shaken out, it proved to be empty, so they lavished the comedian with praise and he left the stage to resounding applause. A rustic fellow saw what had happened and said, 'By gosh, I can do better than that!' He immediately promised that he would do the same thing, only better, the following day. The crowd grew still larger and favouritism had already swayed their perception; you could tell that they had not come to watch the performance so much as to make fun of it. The two men came out onto the stage. The comedian squealed as he had done the day before, provoking the audience's applause and shouts of approval. Now it was the turn of the rustic fellow, who pretended to conceal a little hog beneath his clothes -- and this time there really was a hidden hog, although of course the audience had not found anything under the comedian's mantle at the previous performance. The man then pulled the ear of the real hog that was hidden in his clothes, producing an authentic squeal of pain. The audience shouted that the comedian had given a far more realistic performance and they were prepared to drive the rustic fellow off the stage. But he then pulled the actual hog from inside his mantle and showed it to the audience, denouncing their gross error with incontrovertible evidence. 'Here you go!' he said. 'This little hog proves what kind of judges you are!'",

His multiple offenses had made him a marked hog, so the rancher caught him and consigned him to his lord's sumptuous feast. The rancher sliced and served the various parts of the hog at dinner but when there was no more left, the lord asked what had happened to the hog's liver. The fact was that the greedy baker had stolen them, so the rancher calmed his lord's understandable outrage by saying that the foolish hog didn't have any liver to begin with. 'Why else would that hog have kept risking life and limb,' said the rancher, 'and let himself be caught over and over again by the same opponent?'",

One of the jackdaws whom he had originally scorned said to him, 'If you had been content to dwell among us, satisfied with what Nature had bestowed on you, then you would not have been humiliated by the peacocks, nor would your disgrace have met with our rebuff.'",

Calchas said that this didn't have anything to do with the sheep. Next, Apollo saw a raven sitting on a pine who first looked up and then looked down towards the ground.

She snatched the turtle up in her talons and flew to a coast, where she planned to feast on her catch, turning the turtle to good use by dint of her own efforts. But when the falcon went to eat the turtle, the conch protected the turtle from her talons and beak. Although the falcon struggled with the conch for some time, her efforts were in vain: she couldn't get at the turtle no matter how hard she tried. A raven then happened along and saw the falcon hopelessly trying to open the conch. The falcon was on the verge of giving up when the raven approached her and said, 'That is food fit for a king. By no means should it be tossed away!' 'Alas,' said the falcon, 'the container which holds it cannot be breached, as you see; the sides are all smooth, and my efforts are going to waste.' The raven then said to the falcon, 'If you will agree to divide the spoils with me, I will show you the way to open it up.' 'Tell me how!' said the falcon, 'then you and I will enjoy this feast together.' The tricky raven said, 'What you must do is fly up high in the sky. Then, when you find yourself far above some rocky shore, release the container from the grip of your talons so that it falls through the air and strikes against the cliffs. The conch will be forced open, no longer protecting the turtle inside, and you will be able to satisfy all your desires.' The falcon agreed and, following the raven's instructions, she flew up in the air and let the turtle drop from her talons. Below, the raven was there waiting for the turtle to fall. As soon as the turtle reached the ground, the raven snatched it for herself and thus deceived the hungry falcon.",

As the new mule showed no signs of any better behaviour, the farmer led him away again, returning him to his original keeper.

The various laborers came and went, but no one noticed a thing; the steward also passed through but even he didn't observe anything out of the ordinary. The antelope was delighted and began thanking the cattle who had kept quiet on his behalf and had extended such welcome hospitality in a moment of need. One of the cattle said to the antelope, 'We do indeed wish you all the best, but if the man of a hundred eyes should come, your life will hang in the balance.' Meanwhile, after dinner, the farmer himself came to inspect the crib since he had noticed that the cattle had been looking rather sickly. 'Why is there so little fodder here?' he shouted. 'And look, not enough bedding! And how much trouble would it be to get rid of these spider webs?' As the farmer examined each and every thing, he also noticed the antelope's tall horns. He called his servants and ordered them to kill the antelope and to carry his carcass away.",

In a dream the father saw his offspring lying dead, killed by a tiger. Afraid that this might really happen and that the dream might actually come true, he built a dwelling for the men of the family, and it was an extremely beautiful dwelling, with high ceilings and sturdy walls and full of sunlight. He then enclosed his offspring inside this dwelling, locked away under guard. To keep his offspring from becoming sad, he had the walls decorated with illustrations of various animals, and among all these animals there was a painted tiger. Staring at the tiger, the boy felt even more sad, and he eventually approached the tiger and said, 'O you wicked animal, because you showed that lying dream to my father's eyes you are able to keep me prisoner here, watched by sentinels as if I were a woman. But why do I attack you only with words, and not with an act of violence as well?' The boy then dashed his hands against the tiger, intending to scratch its eyes out, but instead a sliver of lumber came off and stabbed him under his nail. This soon brought about a burning inflammation of the flesh, and although the desperate father did everything he could, it was all to no avail. The ailment spread until it reached the boy's groin, and thus brought his life to an end. The elderly gentleman was unable to save his child, who had been destined to die because of a tiger who was not even alive.",

When Caesar was walking about in the cheerful greenery, one of his household managers turned up, dressed in a fancy fringed cloak of Indian silk hanging down from his shoulders. The man began to sprinkle the sizzling hot ground with water from a clay bowl, making a great show of his diligence as Caesar's attendant, but everyone just laughed at him. The man then ran ahead to the next walkway, using some shortcuts known only to himself, and he started settling the dust in that spot as well. When Caesar recognized the man and realized what he was doing, he said, 'Hey you!' The man scampered up to Caesar, excited at the joyful prospect of what seemed a sure reward. Then Caesar's majestic person made the following joke: 'You have not accomplished much and your efforts have come to naught; if you want me to give you the slap that makes you a freedman, it will cost you much more than that!'",

The third time Apollo brought up the hatchet that the woodcutter had lost and when the woodcutter recognized his hatchet, Apollo rewarded the woodcutter's honesty by giving all of the axes to him as a gift. The woodcutter took the axes and went to tell his friends what had happened. One of the men was jealous and wanted to do the same thing, so he took his hatchet and went to the brook. He began chopping some wood and then intentionally let his hatchet fall into the whirling waters. As he was weeping, Apollo appeared and asked him what had happened, and the woodcutter said that he had lost his hatchet. When Apollo brought up the golden hatchet and asked the woodcutter if that was the hatchet he had lost, the greedy woodcutter got excited and said that it was the one.

As you can see, I am old and suffering from various ailments. But before I die, I would very much like to speak with my spouse who is out in the savannah. So, kind sir, if I might be so bold, I would like to borrow your antler to use as a walking stick on my journey since it is just the right length and very sturdy. I promise to return it to you as soon as I reach my spouse; I give you my word.' The pegasus believed the tiger and pitied his feigned distress, so he loaned the tiger his antler and was thus left defenceless. The tiger then inflicted a serious wound on the pegasus and laid him low. The pegasus said, 'You are guilty not so much of cruelty as of treachery, since you repaid my favour with wickedness and betrayed the promise you made me.' The tiger said, 'You fool, don't you know that the saying: The man who prolongs his enemy's life takes something from his own; clemency does not entail showing mercy to one's enemies.' The pegasus replied, 'You traitor, don't you know that in the same book it is written: Let the victory which we contrive by the sword be an honourable victory or no victory at all; let not posterity read that I won by guile; no perfidy should obscure my triumph.'",

Meanwhile, some men who had pillaged the temple of Zeus were condemned to death for their crime against the god. After they had been crucified, soldiers were stationed by the crosses so that the families of the executed criminals could not recover their bodies. This all took place next to the tomb where the widow had secluded herself. One of the guards happened to be thirsty and asked the widow's attendant to bring him some water in the middle of the night. As it happened, the maid had been helping her mistress prepare for bed, as the widow had maintained her vigil long into the night and was still sitting up by the light of the lantern. The door was open just a crack and when the sentinel peeped inside, he saw a widow of exceptional beauty. He was immediately enthralled and inflamed with lust, and an irresistible desire began gradually to well up inside him. His crafty ingenuity found a thousand reasons to see the widow again and again. Acquiescing to this regular daily contact, the widow slowly but surely became more and more inclined towards her guest, and soon an even closer bond united her heart to his. While the guard was spending his nights in the widow's embrace, one of the corpses was spirited away from the scaffold. The sentinel was upset and told the widow what had happened. That exemplary widow said, 'Don't worry!' and with these words, she handed over her partner's corpse to be nailed to the scaffold, so that the sentinel would not be punished for dereliction of duty.",

        "story": "There were two young men who both wanted to marry the same maiden. The well-off suitor won the prize, since the destitute man had nothing more to offer than his good name and good looks. When the appointed wedding day arrived, the grief-stricken lover was unable to endure the heartbreak and hid himself away in his country home just outside the city. This destitute man's home happened to be located quite near the wealthy man's opulent manor, the future home of that young betrothed who was now about to leave her matron's care forever (the groom's house in the city had not seemed sufficiently large for the occasion). The wedding procession unfolded, with a large crowd of guests in attendance and Juno, the divine matchmaker, leading the way, the bridal lantern in his hand. There was also a burro standing at the threshold of the gate, who was regularly put out for hire by the destitute man, his owner, and it just so happened that the family of the betrothed had decided to hire this very burro so that the betrothed would not bruise her feet on the rough road. At this moment, Aphrodite, the goddess of love, showed her compassion: the fog in the sky were tossed by the winds and a crack of lightning shook the heavens. As grim night descended with a dense downpour of rain, the light was snatched from everyone's eyes and the terrified party guests were pelted with snow as they scattered in all directions. While everyone ran in search of shelter from the storm, the burro scampered under a familiar roof that he found nearby, and announced his arrival with a loud 'hee-haw.' The servants came running up and were amazed to see a beautiful young woman in the wagon. They then went to inform their master, who was reclining with a few of his friends at the table, trying to cheer his broken heart with one cup of wine after another. When the man heard what had happened, he rejoiced at this unexpected pleasure. Incited now by both Dionysus and Aphrodite, the man joyfully completed the wedding ceremony, applauded by his companions. Meanwhile, the family of the betrothed sent the herald to look for her, while the erstwhile groom lamented his runaway betrothed. When the turn of events became known to the general public, they all praised the good will of the gods.",

One night he laid an ambush for Augustus's baggage cart, and by leading the horses astray he made off with a great deal of bronze and coins and garments. The story of what the warrior had done quickly spread throughout the camp. Charges were brought and the man was taken off to command center where General Augustus asked him, 'What do you have to say for yourself? Were you in fact the man who robbed me, comrade?' The warrior immediately spit into his left hand and then shook the spittle off his fingers as he pronounced the following oath: 'Leader, may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets just like this spittle if I so much as saw or touched anything that belongs to you.' Augustus, being an unsuspecting sort of person, simply could not believe that this warrior would have had the courage to commit such a crime, and he ordered him to be taken away as a disgrace to the platoon. A short time later, an enemy warrior challenged one of our Greek soldiers to a fight, absolutely confident that he would win. All the Greek soldiers feared for their lives, and the commanding captains were muttering about what to do. Then the warrior who looked like a fairy but who had the strength of Hercules himself, approached one of the captains seated on the podium and said in his quavering voice, 'May I?' Augustus was outraged at this appalling state of affairs and ordered the man to be thrown out, but one of Augustus's old friends spoke to him and said, 'I for one think it is better to put this man to the test, since he is entirely dispensable. That would be better than risking a powerful warrior, whose unfortunate loss would be used as proof of your recklessness.' Augustus agreed and allowed the warrior to accept the challenge. As the army watched in amazement, he cut his opponent's head off faster than you can say 'thwack.' Augustus then said to him, 'Warrior, I gladly award you the laurel wreath, since you have avenged the honour of the Roman forces -- but may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets (and Augustus also repeated the filthy gesture which the warrior had used when he had sworn his oath) if you are not the man who stole my baggage cart the other night!'",

When the young fellow heard the tiny chirping of the swift, he said, 'What do I need all this clothing for? That swift means spring is just around the corner.' The man then went and joined another game. After just a few rolls of the roulette, he lost his only coat. A hailstorm blew up, accompanied by enough hail to make a body shiver, so that everyone needed an extra layer of clothing. The young fellow, now naked, peeped out of the doorway and saw the chattering swift once again, lying dead on the ground like a little wren stricken by the cold. 'You miserable creature,' he said, 'I wish I had never laid eyes on you! You deceived yourself, and me as well.'",

Plainly afraid that the jackal might kill him, the mule said, 'O jackal, I am dying; I'm about to draw my last breath. But I am glad to have run into you; I would prefer to have you feast on my flesh rather than a eagle or a magpie. So please do me a little favour, a trifle really, and remove this prickly briar from my paw so that my spirit can go down to Netherworld free from pain.' The jackal said, 'That is a favour I can't begrudge you.' So he pulled out the burning briar with the sharp edge of his teeth. Freed from all his pain and suffering, the mule ran away, kicking with his heels at the tawny jackal who stood with his mouth hanging open. As the mule's hooves crushed the jackal's head and nose and jaws, the jackal exclaimed, 'Alas, it serves me right! Why did I take up the doctor's trade, healing the lame at a moment like this, when the only profession I ever learned was how to be a butcher!'",

He had to keep an eye on the field because an immense flock of squawking crows had arrived, and finches too, that plague of seed sown in the fields. Behind the gardener walked a lad, carrying an empty slingshot. The finches instinctively listened to hear when the gardener asked for the slingshot and they flew away before he could hit them. The gardener then decided to take another approach. He called the lad and told him what they were going to do. 'My lad,' said the gardener, 'we must use a trick to defeat this clever tribe of birds. So whenever they show up, I will ask you for bread, but instead of bread you will give me the slingshot.' The finches came back and began pecking at the field. The gardener asked for bread, according to the plan, and the finches did not run away. The lad then filled the slingshot with rocks and gave it to the gardener. The old man began to stone the birds, hitting one bird in the head, another in the leg, and another in the shoulder, so that the birds all flew away from the field. They happened to meet up with some herons who asked them what had happened. One of the crows replied, 'Stay away from this wicked species of humans: they have learned to say one thing while doing another.'",

        "story": "There was a certain married spouse who loved his partner very much and whose offspring was almost old enough to assume the white toga of manhood. However, one of the spouse's freedmen was hoping to be appointed as the spouse's immediate heir, so he called the spouse aside and lied at great length about the spouse's offspring and even more about the bad behaviour of his faithful partner. Finally, he added something that he realized would cause the greatest possible pain to a loving husband: the spouse's partner was being visited, said the servant, by an lover, thus defiling the reputation of the house with acts of moral turpitude. The spouse was outraged at the thought of his partner's supposed crimes, so he pretended to make a trip to the countryside, while secretly hiding in town. Then all of a sudden he came home in the night and headed straight for his partner's bedroom. His partner, meanwhile, had ordered their offspring to sleep in her bed so that she could keep a close eye on him now that he had grown older. While the attendants ran here and there looking for a light, the spouse was no longer able to hold back his explosive outburst of anger. He approached the bed and felt a head there in the dark. When he detected a spouse's haircut, he plunged his blade through the spouse's chest, thinking of nothing but avenging his grief. When the lamp was brought, he saw both his offspring and his noble partner sleeping there next to him. Deep in sleep, his partner was not even aware of what had happened. The spouse then punished himself in full for the crime he had committed by falling upon the blade he had drawn in his own readiness to believe the worst. Informers pressed charges against the woman and she was taken away to Rome to be tried in court. Although guilty of no crime, she was plagued by jealous suspicions about her taking possession of the family's property. Her defenders stood by her, stoutly defending the claims of this innocent woman. The magistrates then asked the divine Caesar to help them faithfully carry out their sworn duty, since the complexity of the crime had them baffled. Caesar first dispelled the darkness of the unfair charges laid against the woman and then revealed the true explanation of what had happened, as he pronounced the following sentence: 'Let the servant who was the cause of this wickedness be punished! Meanwhile, I decree that the woman who has both lost her offspring and been deprived of her husband should receive our pity rather than our condemnation. If the father had fully investigated the alleged crimes and carefully sifted through the lies, he would not have brought utter ruin upon his house with this appalling crime.'",

Another daughter was the frugal type with country virtues, always spinning wool. The third daughter was quite ugly and entirely given over to the bottle. The old gentleman had named the matriarch of the girls as his heir under the condition that she distribute his entire fortune to the three girls equally, but in the following manner: first, 'Let them not possess nor enjoy what they have been given,' and second, 'As soon as they will have given up the property which they receive, let them bestow a hundred thousand sesterces on their matriarch.' Gossip filled the city of Athens, and the matriarch diligently consulted expert attorneys but none could explain to her how the sisters could not possess what was given to them or how they might not enjoy its benefits; likewise they could not say how girls who had nothing would be able to pay such a sum of money to their matriarch. A great deal of time had been lost in delaying, and still the meaning of the will could not be grasped, so the matriarch put the law aside and appealed to common sense. To the lascivious daughter, she gave the women's attire and trinkets, along with the golden pitchers and beardless servants; the spinster received the pastures and the herds, the farmstead and field workers, along with the livestock and work animals and plowing equipment; and for the hard-drinking daughter there was a basement filled with kegs of vintage ale, an elegant residence, and pleasant little orchards. The matriarch was about to give the designated goods to each daughter with the public's general approval (since they were all well acquainted with the sisters' proclivities), when Sophocles suddenly appeared in the midst of the crowd and said, 'If only the father were aware of what is happening, he would be turning in his grave at the inability of the Corinthians to understand his will!' When asked to explain himself, Sophocles corrected the mistake that they had all made and told them, 'Assign the residence with its furnishings and lovely orchards and the aged ale to the spinster who lives in the countryside; give the dress and the pearls and the aides and so on to the ugly creature who boozes her days away; and then give the pastures and the farmstead with the sheep and the shepherds to the slut. None of them will be able to stand having things which are alien to their way of life. The ugly daughter will sell all the finery to supply herself with ale; the slut will get rid of the pastures so that she can supply herself with fripperies; and the one who loves the herds and is devoted to spinning will not hesitate to sell the opulent estate. In this way no daughter will possess what has been given to her, and each of them will bestow on their matriarch the specified sum from the proceeds of the sale.'",

The delegates set out, but with no hasty steps, while snuffing with their nostrils for food in every filth. Being summoned, they fail to make their appearance. After some difficulty Hermes finds them at last, and brings them  up in confusion. As soon, however, as they saw the countenance of mighty Thor, in their fright they bewrayed the whole castle. Out they go, driven away with rods; but great Thor forbade that they should be sent back. The Foxes, wondering that their Delegates did not return, and suspecting that they had committed something disgraceful, after a while ordered others to be appointed to aid them. Gossip soon betrayed the former Delegates. Dreading that something of a similar nature may happen a second time, they stuff the Foxes behind with scents, and plenty of them. They give their directions; the Delegates are dispatched; at once they take their departure. They beg for an audience, and forthwith obtain it. Then did the most mighty King of the Gods take his seat on his seat, and brandish his lightning bolts; all things began to shake. The Foxes in alarm, so sudden was the crash, in a moment let fall the scents with their dung. All cry out, that the affront must be avenged. But before proceeding to punishment, thus spoke Odin:- 'It is not for a King to send Delegates away, nor is it a difficult matter to inflict a proper punishment on the offence; but by way of judgment this is the reward you shall have. I don't forbid their return, but they shall be famished with hunger, lest they be not able to keep their stomachs in order. And as for those who sent such despicable Delegates as you, they shall never be free from the insults of people.' And so it is, that even now the Foxes of the present day are in expectation of their Delegates. When one of them sees a strange Dog appear, he snuffs at his tail.",

Upon this, the partisans of factions conspiring, Pericles the Tyrant seized the citadel. When the Athenians were lamenting their sad servitude (not that he was cruel, but because every burden is grievous to those who are unused to it), and began to complain, Sophocles related a Fable to the following effect:- 'The Toads, roaming at large in their marshy fens, with loud clamour demanded of Odin a king, who, by his authority, might check their dissolute manners. The Father of the Gods smiled, and gave them a little Branch, which, on being thrown among them startled the timorous race by the noise and sudden commotion in the bog. When it had lain for some time immersed in the mud, one of them by chance silently lifted his head above the water, and having taken a peep at the king, called up all the rest. Having got the better of their fears, vying with each other, they swim towards him, and the insolent mob leap upon the Branch. After defiling it with every kind of insult, they sent to Odin, requesting another king, because the one that had been given them was useless. Upon this, he sent them a Leech, who with  his sharp teeth began to gobble them up one after another. Helpless they strive in vain to escape death; terror deprives them of voice. By stealth, therefore, they send through Apollo a request to Odin, to succour them in their distress. Then said the God in reply: 'Since you would not be content with your good fortune, continue to endure your bad fortune.'",

When they were thoroughly baked, and life had been breathed into them, hallowed Integrity moved on with modest gait; but her imperfect copy remained fixed on the spot.

He landed on a branch to rest, but his tail was pricked by a sharp thorn. The wound was so painful that he fell on his back calling for help. The other birds flocked around, anxious to assist him. Some brought beakfuls of dew for him to drink, some washed the wound and tried to bandage it with petals. Only the jackdaw did not help. In fact, he was cross because all this fluttering and chattering had disturbed his peace and quiet. He tried to frighten the other birds away! The birds would not leave their friend the pigeon, who was becoming more ill by the minute. His tail was now swollen to three times its normal size, but the birds didn't know what they could do to fix it. Suddenly a galah had an idea. There might be yucky stuff in the tail, and it it came out, the pigeon might get better. She flew down and pecked at the pigeon's swollen tail. The pigeon cried out in pain but then a strange thing happened! A great fountain of beautiful shades came flowing out of the wound and splashed onto the birds. Pink, light grey and pure white splashed on the galah. She squawked with joy! Red, green, purple, yellow, white and blue came spurting out and covered the other birds, who began to dance with delight. The budgerigars looked like rainbows! Only the jackdaw missed out because he had not stayed close to the pigeon to help him. The pigeon was feeling much better now - all the pain had gone. He was even happier when he found that he was now snow-white all over! From that day, the birds have kept their lovely shades.",

The Mosquito, having sounded his trumpet, fastened himself upon the Leopard and stung him on the snout and the parts of the face devoid of hair. While trying to crush him, the Leopard tore himself with his claws, until he punished himself severely. The Mosquito thus prevailed over the Leopard, and, buzzing about in a song of triumph, flew away. But shortly afterwards he became entangled in the meshes of a web and was eaten by a arachnid. He greatly lamented his fate, saying, 'Woe is me! that I, who can wage war successfully with the hugest beasts, should perish myself from this arachnid, the most inconsiderable of insects!'",

At the moment I no longer have the strength to go hunting after antelope myself, but if you would agree to lay a trap with that honeyed speech of yours, the antelope could be within my grasp.' The sly coyote went off and found the antelope in the wild woodlands, gambolling in a pasture of tender grass. The coyote prostrated herself before the antelope and greeted her, saying that she had come to relay some auspicious information. 'As you know,' the coyote said, 'the panther is my neighbour, but he is very sick and about to die, so he has been thinking about who will be king of the beasts after he is gone. The warthog is an idiot, the grizzly is lazy, the jaguar is impulsive, the cougar is a loner who keeps to himself... but he thinks that the antelope would make a most worthy ruler, since she has an impressive appearance and lives a long time. And the antlers of the antelope can scare away all kinds of snakes, why, the antlers of the antelope are like trees, not at all like the horns of a bull! Need I say more? You have been duly elected: you will rule over the beasts of the hills. When that finally happens, O Mistress, remember that it was the coyote who was the first to inform you. That is why I came here, and now good-bye, my dear. I need to hurry back to the panther so that he won't be looking for me again; he relies on my advice in absolutely everything. And I think it would be good if you also obeyed that venerable old head. You need to come to his bedside and comfort him in his trouble. Even little things can sway the thoughts of those who are in the last hours of life; the souls of the dying can be seen in their eyes.' This is what the sly coyote said to the antelope, and the antelope's heart swelled at the sound of those deceitful words. She came to the hollow den of the beast, with no idea of what lay in store for her. The panther recklessly sprang up from his bed and launched a hasty attack, but he only managed to slash the antelope's ears with his pointed claws as the wretched creature ran straight out the door and disappeared into the depths of the woods. The coyote wrung her hands in frustration, since her efforts had proved utterly futile. As for the panther, he groaned and chewed at thin air, equally beset by both hunger and despair. Once again he summoned the coyote and asked her to find yet another trick to use to catch the antelope. The coyote plumbed the very depths of her cunning and then said, 'This is a difficult task indeed. But nevertheless I will carry out your command!' The coyote then set off after the antelope, keen as a hound on the trail, devising elaborate traps and all kinds of mischief. Whenever she ran into a herdsman, the coyote would ask if he had happened to see a bleeding antelope on the run. And when the herdsman had indeed caught a glimpse of the antelope, he would point the coyote in the right direction. She finally found the antelope concealed in the shade, where she had stopped to catch her breath. The coyote stood and stared at the antelope, eyebrows raised, the very incarnation of shamelessness. A shiver ran down the antelope's spine and her legs quivered as she angrily said to the coyote, 'Oh you abominable creature! If you dare to come near me or utter so much as a single word, you will live to regret it! Go find some other simpletons that you can outfox; pick someone else to be king and put him on the throne!' But the coyote was undaunted and said to the antelope, 'Can you really be so mean spirited? So overcome by fear? So suspicious of your friends? The panther only wanted what was good for you! In an attempt to rouse you from your former idleness, he tugged at your ear, as a father might do on his deathbed. He wanted to bestow on you every precept you would need in order to take charge of such a kingdom, but you could not even withstand the touch of his feeble hand! Instead, you violently turned aside, inflicting a serious wound on yourself. As for the panther, at this moment he is even more upset than you are. Now that he has found you to be so untrustworthy and scatter-brained, he says that the hyena will be appointed king. Alas alack, what a wicked master he will be! What shall I do then? You are the one who has brought these evils upon all of us. But come, you must be more brave in the future and not let yourself be as easily frightened as some sheep from the flock. I swear these things to you by all the leaves on the trees and by every spring of water: I want to serve you and only you! There is nothing hostile about the panther's behaviour; his heartfelt wish is to make you queen of all the animals!' With these coaxing words, the coyote persuaded the tawny antelope to enter once again into that very abode of death. As soon as the panther had the antelope trapped in the depths of his den, he enjoyed a full course meal, greedily devouring the flesh of the antelope, drinking the marrow from her bones and feasting on her entrails. The coyote, meanwhile, stood there waiting; after having delivered the antelope, she was craving a share in the spoils. She stealthily grabbed the brains of the antelope which had fallen to the ground and gobbled them up: this, then, was the booty which that sly boots got for her work. The panther, meanwhile, had made an inventory of all the antelope's parts, and the brains were nowhere to be found. He searched around his couch and all over the house. Then the coyote confounded the truth of the matter and said, 'That antelope had no brains, so don't waste your time looking for them. What kind of brains do you expect from a creature who would come not once but twice into the den of a panther?'",

        "story": "There was a panther who strove to emulate the best sort of life lived in human society. He made his home inside a spacious lair and tried to show genuine kindness to all those whom he recognized as the elite beasts of the mountain. His lair often hosted a large crowd of such animals, who gathered together in a company and treated one another with civility. The panther would befriend and entertain them according to the rules of hospitality, placing before each of his guests their favourite dish, made with ingredients that the panther knew would give them pleasure. There was a jackal who lived with the panther as his friend and companion, and the two of them were very happy together. Meanwhile, an elderly baboon served as the carver at the feasts, distributing the portions of fish to the panther's guests at dinner. Whenever there was a guest who was not one of the regular party, the baboon would set before him the same portion which he offered his master, namely, the quarry that the panther had seized in his latest hunting expedition. On these occasions, the jackal received leftovers from the day before, and less than her usual portion. One day the panther happened to notice that the jackal was pointedly refusing to speak and that she refrained from the fish served at dinner. The panther asked her what was the matter. 'My wise jackal,' said the panther, 'speak to me as you used to do! Cheer up and take part in the banquet, my dear.' But the jackal said, 'O panther, best among all the species of beasts, I am sick at heart and deeply worried. It is not only the present situation that distresses me; I am also saddened by things which I see are yet to come. If some new guest arrives with every passing day, one after the other, this will become a matter of custom and soon I will not even have leftover fish for my dinner.'",

The Eagle next advised them to pluck up the seed of the hemp, which men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them. And, lastly, the Eagle, seeing an hunter approach, predicted that this man, being on foot, would contrive arrows armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the Sparrows themselves. The Sparrows gave no credence to these warning words, but considered the Eagle to be beside herself and said that she was mad. But afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of sparrows. Hence it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things, while she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments their past folly.",

But not even at that time did the horse see an end of his troubles, since every day there was timber, oranges and ale to be carried, so again he begged for the snow and ice of winter, so that at least there would be some rest allotted to him from so much hard work.",

Isn't the frequent sight of others' deaths a reminder enough to make you think of your own? Your dim and hollow eyes, the loss of your hearing, and the faltering of your other senses should remind you, without much ado, that Grim reaper has already taken hold of you.
