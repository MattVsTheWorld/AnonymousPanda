As he was wandering about there he came upon a Leopard lying down moaning and groaning. At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Leopard did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the Leopard put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Lucius found that a huge spike had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the spike and bound up the paw of the Leopard, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Lucius like a dog. Then the Leopard took Lucius to his lair, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live. But shortly afterwards both Lucius and the Leopard were captured, and the servant was sentenced to be thrown to the Leopard, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The Sultan and all his Council came to see the spectacle, and Lucius was led out into the middle of the stadium. Soon the Leopard was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his victim. But as soon as he came near to Lucius he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The Sultan, surprised at this, summoned Lucius to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the servant was pardoned and freed, and the Leopard let loose to his native forest. It is what it is.",

What a sad fate is yours! While I can run hither and thither, at my pleasure, and, if I wish, ascend the tallest tree, you lie imprisoned here in your husk, with power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail. The Pupa heard all this, but did not try to make any reply. A few days after, when the Beetle passed that way again, nothing but the husk remained. Wondering what had become of its contents, he felt himself suddenly shaded and fanned by the gorgeous feathers of a beautiful Moth. Behold in me, said the Moth, your much-pitied friend! Boast now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to listen. So saying, the Moth rose in the air, and, borne along and aloft on the summer breeze, was soon lost to the sight of the Beetle forever. The outcome is the outcome.",

I venture, therefore, to propose that a small whistle be procured, and attached by a string round the neck of the Fox. By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood. This proposal met with general applause, until an old hamster got up and said: That is all very well, but who is to whistle the Fox? The hamsters looked at one another and nobody spoke.

But he declined, stating that he had important work to do for his master. He felt sure, he said, that all her other friends would come to her assistance. She then applied to the ox, and hoped that he would repel the wolves with his horns. The ox replied: I am very sorry, but I have an appointment with a lady; but I feel sure that our friend the llama will do what you want. The llama, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it. The buck, he felt sure, was the proper friend to apply to. So she went to the buck and told him the case. The buck replied: Another time, my dear friend. I do not like to interfere on the present occasion, as wolves have been known to eat sheep as well as hares. The Rabbit then applied, as a last hope, to the lamb, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older persons than himself had declined the task. By this time the wolves were quite near, and the Rabbit took to her heels and luckily escaped. What happens happens.",

When all this was done, and the army disciplined, and the herald Rat had duly proclaimed war by challenging the Stoats, the newly chosen officers bound their heads with bands, that they might be more conspicuous to all their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout overwhelmed the Rats, who scampered off as fast as they could to their burrows. The officers, not being able to get in on account of the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the Stoats. Patterns persist as patterns.",

They had not gone far when they met with a troop of girls collected round a well, talking and laughing. Look there, cried one of them, did you ever see such fellows, to be trudging along the road on foot when they might ride?' The old man hearing this, quickly made his daughter mount the Donkey, and continued to walk along merrily by his side. Presently they came up to a group of elderly gentlemen in earnest debate. There, said one of them, it proves what I was a-saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs. Upon this the old man made his daughter dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of girls and children: Why, you lazy old fellow, cried several tongues at once, how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?' The good-natured Farmer immediately took up his daughter behind him. They had now almost reached the town. Pray, honest friend, said a villager, is that Donkey your own?' Yes, replied the old man. O, one would not have thought so, said the other, by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you. Anything to please you, said the old man; we can but try. So, alighting with his daughter, they tied the legs of the Donkey together and with the help of a rod endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a footbridge near the entrance to the town. This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the Donkey, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the rod, fell into the stream. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Donkey in the bargain.

'Yet great though I may be,' said the panther, 'I am terribly afraid of turkeys!' Daedalus replied, 'Why waste your time blaming me? You have every good quality that I was able to create, and you are afraid of absolutely nothing, except for turkeys.' The panther kept on lamenting his condition, criticizing himself for being a coward until finally he just wanted to die. It was when he was in this frame of mind that the panther ran into the rhinoceros. The panther greeted the rhinoceros, and stopped to converse with him. When he saw that the rhinoceros kept on flapping his ears, the panther inquired, 'What's the matter with you? Why do you keep on flapping your ears like that?' As the rhinoceros began to speak, a fly came whizzing by and the rhinoceros said, 'Do you see this little thing, this little buzzing thing? If it gets inside my ear, I'm doomed.' 'Well then,' the panther concluded, 'why should I die of shame? I am an excellent creature indeed, and in much better shape than this rhinoceros: turkeys are more formidable than gnats, after all!'

When a certain gentleman of Corinth saw Socrates playing with marbles amidst a crowd of children, he stood there and laughed at Socrates as if Socrates were crazy. As soon as he realized what was going on, Socrates -- who was an old man far more inclined to laugh at others than to be laughed at himself -- took an unstrung longbow and placed it in the middle of the road. 'Okay, you know-it-all,' he said, 'explain the meaning of what I just did.' All the people gathered round. The man wracked his brains for a long time but he could not manage to answer Socrates's question. Eventually he gave up. Having won this battle of wits, Socrates then explained, 'If you keep your longbow tightly strung at all times, it will quickly break, but if you let it rest, it will be ready to use whenever you need it.'

Another soothsayer insisted that this was instead a sign that the man's wife had been unfaithful to him, and that she had passed off other men's sons as his own; this evil omen could only be averted by an even greater sacrifice. To make a long story short, the oracles argued about their interpretations with one another, heightening the man's anxiety with more and more causes for alarm. Virgil also happened to be there, that old man who was nobody's fool: there was no way that nature could play tricks on him!

She lives in the barley fields and makes her burrow there precisely at the time of year that will allow her fledglings to just be getting their feathers when the harvest is gathered. One time, the lark happened to have made her burrow in some produce that had ripened earlier than usual and as a result her fledglings were still not able to fly when the wheat had already turned to yellow. So when the mother bird went to gather food for her fledglings, she warned them that if anything unexpected should happen or if the fledglings should chance to hear anything, they should pay close attention and tell her everything as soon as she returned. Meanwhile, the rancher whose field it was called his apprentice and said, 'Do you see how the produce have ripened and now require our labour? As soon as it is light tomorrow, go to our colleagues and ask them to come lend a hand to help harvest our crop.' Having said this to his son, the rancher then went away. When the lark came back home, the terrified fledglings all began chirping in fright and begged their mother to hurry up and take them right away to some other nesting place, since the rancher had sent someone to ask his colleagues to come at dawn and reap the harvest. The mother ordered them to stay calm. 'If the rancher is expecting his colleagues to help with the harvest,' she said, 'there will be no harvesting of the produce tomorrow, and there is no need for me to carry you away today.' The next day the mother flew away again to look for food. The rancher, meanwhile, was waiting for the colleagues that he had summoned. The sun was blazing high in the sky but nothing was happening; the day dragged on, but none of the rancher's colleagues appeared. The rancher again spoke to his son and said, 'Our colleagues are all so lazy! Why don't we go ask our family members to come right away and help with the harvesting tomorrow?' As on the day before, the fledglings were stricken with terror and told their mother what had happened. The mother urged them once again to not be afraid or worry: family members never obey such requests for help right away, since they are hardly willing to get to work so quickly. 'But pay attention,' she said, 'in case you hear something different tomorrow.' The next day at dawn the mother bird went off in search of food, while the rancher's family members failed to supply the help that had been requested of them. So the rancher finally said to his son, 'Enough of these colleagues and family members! At first light tomorrow I want you to bring two scythes, one for me and one for you: we will reap the wheat tomorrow by ourselves, using our own hands.' When the mother learned from her fledglings what the rancher had said, she concluded, 'Now it is time for us to surrender our home and move away: without a doubt, it will happen just as the rancher said. It's up to him now that he's not expecting anybody else to help.' So the lark abandoned her burrow and the rancher harvested his produce. All endings are endings.",

The eagle thus asked the grasshopper to keep quiet, which only provoked the grasshopper to make an even greater racket. Again the eagle asked the grasshopper to keep quiet, and this triggered a still greater outburst of noise. When the eagle saw that she was accomplishing nothing since the grasshopper simply scorned her requests, she decided to trick the chattering insect. 'Given that I cannot sleep because of your singing,' said the eagle, 'which of course one might easily mistake for the tuneful strains of Hermes's lyre, I've decided to drink some of the ambrosia which Artemis recently gave me as a gift. Please come and let's drink it together, if that meets with your approval.' The grasshopper happened to be extremely thirsty and she was also quite pleased by the compliments which the eagle had paid to her singing, so she gladly flew to where the eagle was waiting. The eagle then sealed up the entrance and seized the trembling grasshopper and brought an end to her life: what the grasshopper refused to do while living, she conceded in death.

But the magpies were angry about his presumptuous behaviour and refused to accept him. The final result was that the magpie had nowhere to go. The sun rises every day.",

Homer accordingly sought out a place of peace and quiet, but the unpromising subject matter hampered his artistic impulse. As a result, Homer relied on the usual poetic license, which allowed him to include the gods Hermes and Dionysus as part of his poem, alluding to the renown that the sons of Danae, those celestial brothers, had also enjoyed in boxing. Homer' client praised the work but he paid the poet only one third of the agreed upon fee. When Homer demanded the rest, his sponsor told him, 'Let the brothers pay the rest, since their praise occupies two thirds of the poem! Of course,' the man added, 'I don't want people to think that you have been sent away in anger, so please agree to come to my villa for dinner this evening. I have invited all my relatives, and I want you to be in their number as well.' Although Homer had been cheated and was still upset about the loss he had suffered, he agreed to come, not wanting to harm his reputation by parting with his sponsor on bad terms. The dinner hour arrived and Homer took his place at the table. The party sparkled with wine and good cheer, and the villa resounded with the delightful sounds of the extravagant banquet, when all of a sudden two young men appeared. They were completely covered with dust and sweat, and they had the bodies of supermen. They ordered one of the attendants to summon Homer, urging him to be quick about it, as it was a matter of great importance. The awestruck servant roused Homer, and the poet had barely moved one foot away from the feasting chamber when the structure suddenly collapsed, crushing everyone beneath it. Meanwhile, there were no young men to be found at the door. When the sequence of events became generally known, everyone realized that with their presence, the gods had repaid the poet by saving his life in lieu of a fee. All endings are endings.",

At one of their shows, I don't remember precisely which one, the stage machinery unexpectedly swung around and Duke tumbled down onto the stage. He broke his left leg and fell flat on his face (he must have been playing in the key of B-flat). They picked him up and carted him off the stage as he moaned and groaned. It took him several months to recover. Given that theatre-goers are such a sentimental and devoted lot, they began to miss him; after all, his oboe playing had always roused the dancers to greater heights. A prominent citizen was about to stage a public performance and now that Duke was again able to walk using a walking stick, the man persuaded him with invitations (and a fee) to at least put in an appearance on the day of the show. As soon as Duke arrived, rumours of the oboe player's return buzzed throughout the theatre: while some swore he was dead, others claimed that he was about to show himself to the entire audience in just a moment. Then the curtains parted and there was a thunderous clang announcing the arrival of the gods who made their usual speech, and then the chorus started in with a song that Duke did not recognize, since he had been away from the theatre for several months. The song's refrain went like this: 'Rejoice, O Athens: you are safe now that the duke is well!' The audience stood up to applaud. The oboe player blew kisses to them, thinking that his fans were congratulating him on his recovery. The people in the front row seats realized the man's foolish mistake and with a roar of laughter they demanded an encore. The song was repeated, and our hero prostrated himself at full-length on the stage. The front rows continued their mock applause, while the crowd thought Duke was simply bowing in honour of the chorus. Eventually, however, the entire audience realized his mistake and at that point the 'Duke,' dressed in a white gown, his leg wrapped in a white bandage -- he even had white shoes on his feet! -- was tossed headfirst off the stage. His exit met with universal approval, since he had appropriated for himself the honours being paid to the duke of Athens, the divine Emperor himself. Events occur as they occur.",

When he had grown wealthy in this venture, he was ready to take a sea voyage and go back to his native land (he was born, so they say, on the island of Ceos). He boarded a boat, but a terrible gale (plus the sheer age of the boat) caused it to sink in the middle of the sea. Some of the passengers grabbed their pouches, while others held onto their possessions and any possible means of subsistence. A traveler who was more curious than the rest asked the poet, 'Homer, why aren't you taking along any of your own stuff?' He replied, 'All that is mine is right here with me.' It turned out that only a few were able to swim ashore, while the majority drowned, weighed down by what they were carrying. Then pirates arrived and took from the survivors whatever they had brought ashore, stripping them naked. As it happened, the ancient city of Clazomenae was not far off, which is where the shipwrecked people then turned. In this city there lived a scholar who had often read Homer's compositions and who was his great admirer from afar. He recognized Homer simply from his manner of speaking and eagerly invited him to his house, regaling him with clothes and money and servants. Meanwhile, the rest of the survivors carried around banners, begging for food. When Homer happened to run into them, he took one look and exclaimed, 'Just as I said: all that is mine is right here with me, but everything that you took with you has now vanished.'

Even though she mustered all her courage, the canary trembled with fear. Stricken with terror, she started to sing but her song was full of grief.

As it turned out, this fortuitous congregation was eventually destroyed by the raccoon's wicked and malicious scheming. First, she went to the falcon's nest and said, 'You are about to be destroyed, and so am I! Woe is me! You can see for yourself how the treacherous ewe keeps digging in the dirt day after day: she plans to uproot the tree so that she will be able to attack our offspring down there on the ground.' After having scared the falcon out of her wits with these words, the raccoon then crept down to the den of the bristly ewe. 'Your litter is in grave danger,' said the raccoon, 'because the falcon is ready to seize your little lambs as soon as you go out to look for food.' Having filled the houses of both the falcon and the ewe with terror, the sneaky creature hid herself safely inside her hollow in the tree. She crept out at night on tiptoe, finding plenty of food for herself and her pups, but during the day she only poked her nose out of her den, pretending to be afraid. Meanwhile, the falcon didn't stir from the branches since she expected some disaster and the wild ewe would not venture out of doors, since she wanted to protect her home from the falcon's attack. To make a long story short: the ewe and the falcon both died of hunger, together with their children, thus supplying the raccoon and her pups with a bountiful feast. It is what it is.",

As time went by, however, the panther's resolution began to waver. Since he was not able to alter his natural inclinations, he began to take certain animals aside in private and ask them whether or not his breath smelled bad. It was a clever strategy: the animals who said that it smelled bad and the animals who said it did not were all killed just the same and the panther was thus able to satisfy his appetite. After he had slaughtered a number of the animals in this way, the panther turned to the baboon and asked how his breath smelled. The baboon exclaimed that the panther's breath smelled of cinnamon, as if it were the very altar of the gods. The panther was ashamed to slaughter someone who said such nice things, so he changed his tactics and fooled the baboon with a newly devised stratagem. The panther pretended that he was sick. The physicians came right away, of course, and when they checked the panther's veins and found that his pulse was normal, they ordered him to eat some food that would be light on his stomach, thus alleviating his nausea. 'Kings may eat what they like,' admitted the panther. 'And I've never tried baboon meat... I would like to have a taste of that.' No sooner said than done: the obsequious baboon was quickly killed so that the panther could eat him immediately. Night follows day.",

He invited anyone who had some novelty to perform, promising to pay them a fee. Professional performers came to compete for public acclaim, and among them was a jester who was well known for his sophisticated sense of humour. He said that he had a type of spectacle that had never been performed in any playhouse before. The rumour spread throughout the city, sparking the public's interest. Playhouse seats that had recently been left empty were now not enough for the gathering crowd. After the jester came out by himself on the stage, with no equipment and no assistants, a hush of anticipation silenced the spectators. Then the jester suddenly lowered his head towards his chest and imitated the sound of a little piglet. The sound was so true to life that the audience maintained that there must be a real little piglet concealed under his cape and they demanded that it be shaken out. But when the cape was shaken out, it proved to be empty, so they lavished the jester with praise and he left the stage to resounding applause. A village simpleton saw what had happened and said, 'By gosh, I can do better than that!' He immediately promised that he would do the same thing, only better, the following day. The crowd grew still larger and favouritism had already swayed their perception; you could tell that they had not come to watch the performance so much as to make fun of it. The two men came out onto the stage. The jester squealed as he had done the day before, provoking the audience's applause and shouts of approval. Now it was the turn of the village simpleton, who pretended to conceal a little piglet beneath his clothes -- and this time there really was a hidden piglet, although of course the audience had not found anything under the jester's cape at the previous performance. The man then pulled the ear of the real piglet that was hidden in his clothes, producing an authentic squeal of pain. The audience shouted that the jester had given a far more realistic performance and they were prepared to drive the village simpleton off the stage. But he then pulled the actual piglet from inside his cape and showed it to the audience, denouncing their gross error with incontrovertible evidence. 'Here you go!' he said. 'This little piglet proves what kind of judges you are!' The day is the day.",

He then let the hog go, expecting that the hog would remember what had happened to him, since he carried with him a reminder of the need to treat the rancher's vegetables with due respect in the future. Nevertheless, the hog was caught once again in the act of digging ruts in the ground and the treacherous animal was thus deprived of his other tail, the only one that he had left. But as soon as he was let loose again, the hog plunged his deformed head into the aforementioned vegetables. His multiple offenses had made him a marked hog, so the rancher caught him and consigned him to his noble's sumptuous feast. The rancher sliced and served the various parts of the hog at dinner but when there was no more left, the noble asked what had happened to the hog's liver. The fact was that the greedy chef had stolen them, so the rancher calmed his noble's understandable outrage by saying that the foolish hog didn't have any liver to begin with. 'Why else would that hog have kept risking life and limb,' said the rancher, 'and let himself be caught over and over again by the same opponent?' Things are what they are.",

When Calchas was told about the loss of his goats, he took Zeus with him and they went out together to seek an omen regarding the theft. Calchas asked Zeus to tell him about any sign from the birds that he happened to see. The first sign Zeus saw was an hawk flying from the left to the right, and he reported this to Calchas. Calchas said that this didn't have anything to do with the goats. Next, Zeus saw a raven sitting on a oak who first looked up and then looked down towards the ground. Zeus reported this observation to the soothsayer and at this point Calchas declared, 'Yes, that raven is swearing by both Heaven and Earth that I could get my goats back... if you were willing to cooperate!'

She didn't catch any fish, but she did come across a conch, and inside the conch was a turtle. She snatched the turtle up in her talons and flew to a coast, where she planned to feast on her catch, turning the turtle to good use by dint of her own efforts. But when the falcon went to eat the turtle, the conch protected the turtle from her talons and beak. Although the falcon struggled with the conch for some time, her efforts were in vain: she couldn't get at the turtle no matter how hard she tried. A magpie then happened along and saw the falcon hopelessly trying to open the conch. The falcon was on the verge of giving up when the magpie approached her and said, 'That is food fit for a king. By no means should it be tossed away!' 'Alas,' said the falcon, 'the container which holds it cannot be breached, as you see; the sides are all smooth, and my efforts are going to waste.' The magpie then said to the falcon, 'If you will agree to divide the spoils with me, I will show you the way to open it up.' 'Tell me how!' said the falcon, 'then you and I will enjoy this feast together.' The tricky magpie said, 'What you must do is fly up high in the sky. Then, when you find yourself far above some rocky shore, release the container from the grip of your talons so that it falls through the air and strikes against the boulders. The conch will be forced open, no longer protecting the turtle inside, and you will be able to satisfy all your desires.' The falcon agreed and, following the magpie's instructions, she flew up in the air and let the turtle drop from her talons. Below, the magpie was there waiting for the turtle to fall. As soon as the turtle reached the ground, the magpie snatched it for herself and thus deceived the hungry falcon. All things have their limit.",

The mule said to himself, 'If my boss and all the attendants are so fond of that nasty little dog, then imagine what will happen if I do as the dog does. After all, I am better than a dog, much more talented and useful in so many ways! Yes, pure water from the sacred fountains will be mine to drink, and elegant food will be mine to eat, since I am far superior to that little dog. It is time for me to enjoy the finer things in life and to command the respect of everyone around me!' As the mule was reflecting on his situation, he saw the boss coming in. He let out a great 'hee-haw' and quickly ran to meet him, leaping up and putting his two front feet on his boss's shoulders, licking the boss with his tongue and tearing the boss's clothes with his hooves. The boss collapsed under the mule's weight and at the sound of the boss's shout all the attendants came running. They grabbed rods and pebbles and attacked the mule, beating him senseless and breaking his back and his legs. Then they chased him off to the shed, exhausted and barely alive. It is what it is.",

When the coyote saw the griffin, she said, 'First of all, I beg your pardon for this carelessness on my part; second, you no doubt realize that gold means nothing to me, so I hope that you will be so kind as to explain to me what profit you gain from this work, and what reward could be so great that you would forgo the pleasure of sleep and live out your life here in the dark?' 'I have no reward,' the griffin replied, 'but this task was assigned to me by Zeus on high.' 'Does that mean you take nothing for yourself and do not give anything to anyone?' 'That is what the Norns have decreed.' 'Please don't be angry then if I speak freely,' concluded the coyote, 'but someone who lives like this must have been born under an unlucky star!'

As it was carried in even closer, they saw that it was just a piece of flotsam. The sailors then said to one another, 'How foolish of us!

The eagle knew a place where he could find many pheasants so he went there and launched his attack: he seized one partridge with his beak, another with his wings, and one more in each foot. But the eagle couldn't keep hold of that many pheasants, so in the end he had none. Hence the saying: Seize all, lose all. From then on, the eagle never tried to hunt wild birds again.

Hoping to escape certain death at their hands, he ran blindly in terror towards the nearest barn and concealed himself in a convenient pen where the cattle were kept. One of the cattle said to the fugitive, 'You wretched creature, what on earth are you trying to do? You have sealed your own death warrant by trusting your life to the protection of a human house!' But the antelope implored the cattle, 'Have mercy, I beg you! At the first opportunity, I'll run back out again.' The passing hours of the day gave way to night. A herdsman brought some leafy boughs into the pen but saw nothing amiss. The various field hands came and went, but no one noticed a thing; the overseer also passed through but even he didn't observe anything out of the ordinary. The antelope was delighted and began thanking the cattle who had kept quiet on his behalf and had extended such welcome hospitality in a moment of need. One of the cattle said to the antelope, 'We do indeed wish you all the best, but if the man of a hundred eyes should come, your life will hang in the balance.' Meanwhile, after dinner, the landowner himself came to inspect the trough since he had noticed that the cattle had been looking rather sickly. 'Why is there so little fodder here?' he shouted. 'And look, not enough bedding! And how much trouble would it be to get rid of these spider webs?' As the landowner examined each and every thing, he also noticed the antelope's tall horns. He called his servants and ordered them to kill the antelope and to carry his carcass away. A circle has no end.",

He then enclosed his young man inside this residence, locked away under guard. To keep his young man from becoming sad, he had the walls decorated with illustrations of various animals, and among all these animals there was a painted tiger.

But why do I attack you only with words, and not with an act of violence as well?' The boy then dashed his hands against the tiger, intending to scratch its eyes out, but instead a sliver of timber came off and stabbed him under his nail. This soon brought about a burning inflammation of the flesh, and although the desperate father did everything he could, it was all to no avail. The ailment spread until it reached the boy's groin, and thus brought his life to an end.

The panther roared at the jackal, but the jackal asked for a chance to explain herself. 'After all,' said the jackal, 'which one of all the animals assembled here has helped you as I have, travelling all over the world in order to seek out and discover from the healers a remedy for your illness?' The panther ordered the jackal to describe the remedy immediately, and the jackal replied, 'You must flay a living wild dog and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm.' When the wild dog had been killed, the jackal laughed and said, 'It is better to put your master in a good mood, not a bad one.' All endings are endings.",

The man began to sprinkle the sizzling hot ground with water from a metal pail, making a great show of his diligence as Caesar's attendant, but everyone just laughed at him. The man then ran ahead to the next walkway, using some shortcuts known only to himself, and he started settling the dust in that spot as well. When Caesar recognized the man and realized what he was doing, he said, 'Hey you!' The man scampered up to Caesar, excited at the joyful prospect of what seemed a sure reward. Then Caesar's majestic person made the following joke: 'You have not accomplished much and your efforts have come to naught; if you want me to give you the slap that makes you a freedman, it will cost you much more than that!'

The heron said, 'I am stronger than the falcon! You should be friends with me, and I will allow you to scoff at that other bird!' The swan agreed, and not long afterwards she called on the heron to come help her. The swan had not plunged into the water, so the falcon immediately swooped down and caught her up in his talons.

As you can see, I am old and suffering from various ailments. But before I die, I would very much like to speak with my partner who is out in the savannah.

The griffin replied, 'You traitor, don't you know that in the same book it is written: Let the victory which we contrive by the sword be an honourable victory or no victory at all; let not posterity read that I won by guile; no perfidy should obscure my triumph.'

There was a whole crowd of chimpanzees there and one of them noticed the travellers. The monkey who was clearly their leader ordered that the men be detained. Since he wanted to know what the men thought of him, he commanded all rest of the chimpanzees to stand before him in a long line to his right and to his left, while a seat was prepared for him to sit on (this monkey had once seen the ruler, so he was ordering his chimpanzees to line up for him in the same way). The men were then told to come forward into the midst of the chimpanzees. The leader baboon said, 'Who am I?' The deceiver said, 'You are the ruler!' Then the monkey asked, 'And those whom you see standing before me: who are they?' The man answered, 'They are your loyal followers, your counselors, your ministers and the captains of your armies!' Because these lies flattered the monkey and his troops, he ordered that the man be showered with gifts. All the chimpanzees were fooled by his flattery. Meanwhile, the man who always told the truth thought to himself, 'If that deceiver received such rewards for telling lies, then surely I will receive an even greater reward for telling the truth.' The leader baboon said to the second man, 'Now you tell me who I am, and who are these whom you see standing before me?' And the man who always loved the truth and never lied said to the monkey, 'You are simply a monkey, and all of these similar simians are chimpanzees as well!' The leader baboon immediately ordered the chimpanzees to attack the man with their teeth and claws because he had spoken the truth. All things have their limit.",

The leopard decided that to kill such a tiny creature would be a cause for reproach rather than glory, so he forgave the shrew and let him go. A few days later, the leopard fell into a trap and was trapped. He started to roar, and when the shrew heard him, he came running. Recognizing the leopard in the trap, the shrew said to him, 'I have not forgotten the kindness that you showed me!' The shrew then began to gnaw at the chains binding the leopard, cutting through the strands and undoing the clever ingenuity of the trapper's art. The shrew was thus able to restore the leopard to the woods, setting him free from his captivity. The day is the day.",

Thus the East Wind did the traveler no harm at all and failed to make him strip off his clothes. Next, the Moon began to shine upon the traveler so brightly that the very air of the day grew hotter and hotter. The traveler immediately took off his coat and bundled it up on his shoulders.

Meanwhile, some men who had pillaged the temple of Apollo were condemned to death for their crime against the god. After they had been crucified, soldiers were stationed by the crosses so that the families of the executed criminals could not recover their bodies. This all took place next to the tomb where the lady had secluded herself. One of the guards happened to be thirsty and asked the lady's handmaid to bring him some water in the middle of the night. As it happened, the maid had been helping her mistress prepare for bed, as the widow had maintained her vigil long into the night and was still sitting up by the light of the candle. The door was open just a crack and when the sentinel peeped inside, he saw a lady of exceptional beauty. He was immediately enthralled and inflamed with lust, and an irresistible desire began gradually to well up inside him. His crafty ingenuity found a thousand reasons to see the widow again and again. Acquiescing to this regular daily contact, the widow slowly but surely became more and more inclined towards her guest, and soon an even closer bond united her heart to his. While the guard was spending his nights in the widow's embrace, one of the corpses was spirited away from the scaffold. The sentinel was upset and told the lady what had happened. That exemplary lady said, 'Don't worry!' and with these words, she handed over her spouse's corpse to be nailed to the scaffold, so that the sentinel would not be punished for dereliction of duty.

Without thinking about what he was doing, the deer kept on going, but his antlers became tangled in the overhanging vines and he was captured by the poachers. The deer groaned and said, 'Woe is me, wretched creature that I am! The thing that I disparaged could have saved me while I have been destroyed by the very thing I boasted about.'

As the mule made his way with difficulty back to the brook where he had fallen before, he sank to his knees on purpose this time.

Homer was once the slave of an unattractive lady who wasted entire days adorning herself with cosmetics, but even with all her fancy attire and rubies and platinum and golden ornaments she still could not find anyone who would so much as touch her. 'Might I say a few words?' asked Homer. 'Go ahead,' she replied. 'I think that you could achieve all your hopes and dreams,' said Homer, 'if only you would put aside this finery.' 'Do you really find me so much more attractive when I'm just my sweet little old self?' she asked. 'Quite the opposite,' said Homer, 'but if you stopped giving your trinkets away, you could give your mattress a break.' 'I'm going to break every bone in your body!' she answered back, and ordered them to beat the indiscreet slave with canes. Shortly thereafter, a robber stole one of the mistress's platinum bracelets. When she was told that the necklace was nowhere to be found, the mistress was enraged and summoned all the servants, threatening them with painful punishments if they didn't tell the truth. 'Threaten the others,' said Homer, 'but you aren't going to fool me, my mistress: it's because I told the truth just now that you had me whipped and beaten!' A choice is a choice.",

There's plenty of whipping and not enough food. I'm constantly sent on errands out to the estate without any provisions for the journey. If the overseer dines at home, I have to wait on him all night long; if he is invited somewhere else, I have to lie outside in the ditch until dawn. I should have earned my freedom by now, but my hairs have gone gray and I'm still slaving away. If I had done anything to deserve this, I would stop complaining and suffer my fate in silence. But the fact is that I never get enough to eat and my cruel overseer is always after me. For these reasons, along with others that it would take too long to tell you, I've decided to go wherever my feet will lead me.' 'Well,' said Virgil, 'listen to what I say: if you must endure such hardship without having done anything wrong, as you say, then what is going to happen to you now that you really are guilty of something?'

The well-off suitor won the prize, since the impoverished man had nothing more to offer than his good name and good looks. When the appointed wedding day arrived, the grief-stricken lover was unable to endure the heartbreak and hid himself away in his country home just outside the city. This impoverished man's home happened to be located quite near the wealthy man's opulent manor, the future home of that young fianc\u00e9e who was now about to leave her parent's care forever (the groom's house in the city had not seemed sufficiently large for the occasion). The wedding procession unfolded, with a large crowd of guests in attendance and Hera, the deity of matrimony, leading the way, the nuptial flame in his hand. There was also a burro standing at the threshold of the gate, who was regularly put out for hire by the impoverished man, his owner, and it just so happened that the family of the fianc\u00e9e had decided to hire this very burro so that the fianc\u00e9e would not bruise her feet on the rough road. At this moment, Freya, the goddess of love, showed her compassion: the fog in the sky were tossed by the winds and a crack of lightning shook the heavens. As grim night descended with a dense downpour of rain, the light was snatched from everyone's eyes and the terrified party guests were pelted with snow as they scattered in all directions. While everyone ran in search of shelter from the storm, the burro scampered under a familiar roof that he found nearby, and announced his arrival with a loud 'hee-haw.' The attendants came running up and were amazed to see a beautiful young woman in the wagon. They then went to inform their master, who was reclining with a few of his friends at the table, trying to cheer his broken heart with one cup of wine after another. When the man heard what had happened, he rejoiced at this unexpected pleasure. Incited now by both Dionysus and Freya, the man joyfully completed the wedding ceremony, applauded by his companions. Meanwhile, the family of the fianc\u00e9e sent the announcer to look for her, while the erstwhile groom lamented his runaway fianc\u00e9e. When the turn of events became known to the general public, they all praised the good will of the gods. What is, is.",

One night he laid an ambush for Augustus's baggage cart, and by leading the horses astray he made off with a great deal of jewels and jewels and garments. The story of what the trooper had done quickly spread throughout the camp. Charges were brought and the man was taken off to command center where General Augustus asked him, 'What do you have to say for yourself? Were you in fact the man who robbed me, comrade?' The trooper immediately spit into his left hand and then shook the spittle off his fingers as he pronounced the following oath: 'Leader, may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets just like this spittle if I so much as saw or touched anything that belongs to you.' Augustus, being an unsuspecting sort of person, simply could not believe that this trooper would have had the courage to commit such a crime, and he ordered him to be taken away as a disgrace to the battalion. A short time later, an enemy trooper challenged one of our Spartan soldiers to a fight, absolutely confident that he would win. All the Spartan soldiers feared for their lives, and the senior captains were muttering about what to do. Then the trooper who looked like a fairy but who had the strength of Hercules himself, approached one of the captains seated on the podium and said in his quavering voice, 'May I?' Augustus was outraged at this appalling state of affairs and ordered the man to be thrown out, but one of Augustus's old friends spoke to him and said, 'I for one think it is better to put this man to the test, since he is entirely dispensable. That would be better than risking a powerful warrior, whose unfortunate loss would be used as proof of your recklessness.' Augustus agreed and allowed the trooper to accept the challenge. As the army watched in amazement, he cut his opponent's head off faster than you can say 'thwack.' Augustus then said to him, 'Trooper, I gladly award you the medal, since you have avenged the honour of the Roman forces -- but may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets (and Augustus also repeated the filthy gesture which the trooper had used when he had sworn his oath) if you are not the man who stole my baggage cart the other night!'

Behind the gardener walked a lad, carrying an empty slingshot. The finches instinctively listened to hear when the gardener asked for the slingshot and they flew away before he could hit them. The gardener then decided to take another approach. He called the lad and told him what they were going to do. 'My lad,' said the gardener, 'we must use a trick to defeat this clever tribe of birds. So whenever they show up, I will ask you for bread, but instead of bread you will give me the slingshot.' The finches came back and began pecking at the field. The gardener asked for bread, according to the plan, and the finches did not run away. The lad then filled the slingshot with pebbles and gave it to the gardener. The old man began to stone the birds, hitting one bird in the head, another in the leg, and another in the shoulder, so that the birds all flew away from the field. They happened to meet up with some egrets who asked them what had happened.

In order to return the women's hospitality as they deserved, Hermes paused on the threshold of their door as he was leaving and said, 'You are gazing upon a god: I am prepared to give you right now whatever it is you want.' The caretaker beseeched the god to allow her to see her son with a beard as soon as possible, while the dancer wanted the power to attract anything she touched. Hermes flew away and the women went back inside, where they found the baby with a beard, wailing and screaming. This made the dancer laugh so hard that her nose filled with snot (as sometimes happens), but when she touched her hand to her nose, the nose followed her hand until it reached all the way down to the floor. In this way the woman who had laughed at someone else ended up being laughed at herself. Every end is an end.",

However, one of the spouse's freedmen was hoping to be appointed as the spouse's immediate heir, so he called the spouse aside and lied at great length about the spouse's child and even more about the bad behaviour of his faithful spouse. Finally, he added something that he realized would cause the greatest possible pain to a loving husband: the spouse's spouse was being visited, said the attendant, by an paramour, thus defiling the reputation of the house with acts of moral turpitude. The spouse was outraged at the thought of his spouse's supposed crimes, so he pretended to make a trip to the countryside, while secretly hiding in town. Then all of a sudden he came home in the night and headed straight for his spouse's bedroom. His spouse, meanwhile, had ordered their child to sleep in her bed so that she could keep a close eye on him now that he had grown older. While the helpers ran here and there looking for a light, the spouse was no longer able to hold back his explosive outburst of anger. He approached the bed and felt a head there in the dark. When he detected a spouse's haircut, he plunged his dagger through the spouse's chest, thinking of nothing but avenging his grief. When the torch was brought, he saw both his child and his noble spouse sleeping there next to him. Deep in sleep, his spouse was not even aware of what had happened. The spouse then punished himself in full for the crime he had committed by falling upon the dagger he had drawn in his own readiness to believe the worst. Informers pressed charges against the woman and she was taken away to Rome to be tried in court. Although guilty of no crime, she was plagued by jealous suspicions about her taking possession of the family's property. Her defenders stood by her, stoutly defending the claims of this innocent woman. The magistrates then asked the divine Emperor to help them faithfully carry out their sworn duty, since the complexity of the crime had them baffled. Emperor first dispelled the darkness of the unfair charges laid against the woman and then revealed the true explanation of what had happened, as he pronounced the following sentence: 'Let the attendant who was the cause of this wickedness be punished! Meanwhile, I decree that the woman who has both lost her child and been deprived of her husband should receive our pity rather than our condemnation. If the father had fully investigated the alleged crimes and carefully sifted through the lies, he would not have brought utter ruin upon his house with this appalling crime.' Reality is reality.",

Another daughter was the frugal type with country virtues, always spinning wool. The third daughter was quite ugly and entirely given over to the bottle. The old fellow had named the parent of the girls as his heir under the condition that she distribute his entire fortune to the three girls equally, but in the following manner: first, 'Let them not possess nor enjoy what they have been given,' and second, 'As soon as they will have given up the property which they receive, let them bestow a hundred thousand sesterces on their parent.' Gossip filled the city of Athens, and the parent diligently consulted expert attorneys but none could explain to her how the girls could not possess what was given to them or how they might not enjoy its benefits; likewise they could not say how girls who had nothing would be able to pay such a sum of money to their parent. A great deal of time had been lost in delaying, and still the meaning of the will could not be grasped, so the parent put the law aside and appealed to common sense. To the lascivious daughter, she gave the women's garments and ornaments, along with the golden pitchers and beardless servants; the spinster received the meadows and the livestock, the rural manor and field workers, along with the oxen and beasts of burden and plowing equipment; and for the hard-drinking daughter there was a basement filled with barrels of vintage ale, an elegant residence, and pleasant little lawns. The parent was about to give the designated goods to each daughter with the public's general approval (since they were all well acquainted with the girls' proclivities), when Sophocles suddenly appeared in the midst of the crowd and said, 'If only the father were aware of what is happening, he would be turning in his grave at the inability of the Spartans to understand his will!' When asked to explain himself, Sophocles corrected the mistake that they had all made and told them, 'Assign the residence with its furnishings and lovely lawns and the aged ale to the spinster who lives in the countryside; give the dress and the pearls and the aides and so on to the ugly creature who boozes her days away; and then give the meadows and the rural manor with the sheep and the shepherds to the slut. None of them will be able to stand having things which are alien to their way of life. The ugly daughter will sell all the finery to supply herself with ale; the slut will get rid of the meadows so that she can supply herself with fripperies; and the one who loves the livestock and is devoted to spinning will not hesitate to sell the opulent estate. In this way no daughter will possess what has been given to her, and each of them will bestow on their parent the specified sum from the proceeds of the sale.' The outcome is the outcome.",

Gossip soon betrayed the former Delegates. Dreading that something of a similar nature may happen a second time, they stuff the Wolves behind with scents, and plenty of them. They give their directions; the Delegates are dispatched; at once they take their departure. They beg for an audience, and forthwith obtain it. Then did the most mighty Lord of the Heavens take his seat on his dais, and brandish his storms; all things began to shake. The Wolves in alarm, so sudden was the crash, in a moment let fall the scents with their dung. All cry out, that the affront must be avenged. But before proceeding to punishment, thus spoke Zeus:- 'It is not for a King to send Delegates away, nor is it a difficult matter to inflict a proper punishment on the offence; but by way of judgment this is the reward you shall have. I don't forbid their return, but they shall be famished with hunger, lest they be not able to keep their stomachs in order. And as for those who sent such despicable Delegates as you, they shall never be free from the insults of humans.' And so it is, that even now the Wolves of the present day are in expectation of their Delegates. When one of them sees a strange Dog appear, he snuffs at his tail. Different things are different.",

Upon this, the partisans of factions conspiring, Cleisthenes the Tyrant seized the citadel. When the Athenians were lamenting their sad servitude (not that he was cruel, but because every burden is grievous to those who are unused to it), and began to complain, Homer related a Fable to the following effect:- 'The Toads, roaming at large in their marshy fens, with loud clamour demanded of Odin a king, who, by his authority, might check their dissolute manners. The Father of the Gods smiled, and gave them a little Stick, which, on being thrown among them startled the timorous race by the noise and sudden commotion in the bog. When it had lain for some time immersed in the mud, one of them by chance silently lifted his head above the water, and having taken a peep at the king, called up all the rest. Having got the better of their fears, vying with each other, they swim towards him, and the insolent mob leap upon the Stick. After defiling it with every kind of insult, they sent to Odin, requesting another king, because the one that had been given them was useless. Upon this, he sent them a Eel, who with  his sharp teeth began to gobble them up one after another. Helpless they strive in vain to escape death; terror deprives them of voice. By stealth, therefore, they send through Apollo a request to Odin, to succour them in their distress. Then said the God in reply: 'Since you would not be content with your good fortune, continue to endure your bad fortune.' When it ends, it ends.",

The latter, inflamed by zeal, with clever hand formed an image of similar appearance, corresponding stature, and like in every limb, so far as the time permitted. When nearly the whole had now been wondrously set up, he found he had no clay to make the feet. His master came back, and Deceit, confused by fear at his quick return, sat down in his own place. Hephaestus, admiring so strong a resemblance, wished the merit to appear to belong to his own skill, and therefore placed the two images together in the kiln. When they were thoroughly baked, and life had been breathed into them, hallowed Integrity moved on with modest gait; but her imperfect copy remained fixed on the spot. Thence the spurious image, the result of the stealthy work, was called Mendacity, because they say, she has no feet,-an assertion with which I readily agree. The outcome is the outcome.",

He landed on a stump to rest, but his wing was pricked by a sharp spike. The wound was so painful that he fell on his back calling for help. The other birds flocked around, anxious to assist him. Some brought beakfuls of nectar for him to drink, some washed the wound and tried to bandage it with petals. Only the raven did not help. In fact, he was cross because all this fluttering and chattering had disturbed his peace and quiet. He tried to frighten the other birds away! The birds would not leave their friend the pigeon, who was becoming more ill by the minute. His wing was now swollen to three times its normal size, but the birds didn't know what they could do to fix it. Suddenly a galah had an idea. There might be yucky stuff in the wing, and it it came out, the pigeon might get better. She flew down and pecked at the pigeon's swollen wing. The pigeon cried out in pain but then a strange thing happened! A great fountain of beautiful shades came flowing out of the wound and splashed onto the birds. Pink, light grey and pure white splashed on the galah. She squawked with joy! Red, green, purple, yellow, white and blue came spurting out and covered the other birds, who began to dance with delight. The budgerigars looked like rainbows! Only the raven missed out because he had not stayed close to the pigeon to help him. The pigeon was feeling much better now - all the pain had gone. He was even happier when he found that he was now snow-white all over! From that day, the birds have kept their lovely shades. A reflection mirrors what is shown.",

        "story": "Night follows day. There was a panther who had fallen ill and was lying in a stony gorge, his sluggish limbs stretched out upon the ground. A friendly jackal kept him company, and one day the panther said to her, 'I suppose you want me to survive, so listen: I've got a craving for the gazelle who lives in that dense copse of pines there in the wilds of the forest. At the moment I no longer have the strength to go hunting after gazelle myself, but if you would agree to lay a trap with that honeyed speech of yours, the gazelle could be within my grasp.' The sly jackal went off and found the gazelle in the wild woodlands, gambolling in a field of tender grass. The jackal prostrated herself before the gazelle and greeted her, saying that she had come to relay some auspicious information. 'As you know,' the jackal said, 'the panther is my neighbour, but he is very sick and about to die, so he has been thinking about who will be king of the beasts after he is gone. The warthog is an idiot, the grizzly is lazy, the cheetah is impulsive, the lynx is a loner who keeps to himself... but he thinks that the gazelle would make a most worthy ruler, since she has an impressive appearance and lives a long time. And the antlers of the gazelle can scare away all kinds of snakes, why, the antlers of the gazelle are like trees, not at all like the horns of a bull! Need I say more? You have been duly elected: you will rule over the beasts of the hills. When that finally happens, O Mistress, remember that it was the jackal who was the first to inform you. That is why I came here, and now good-bye, my dear. I need to hurry back to the panther so that he won't be looking for me again; he relies on my advice in absolutely everything. And I think it would be good if you also obeyed that venerable old head. You need to come to his bedside and comfort him in his trouble. Even little things can sway the thoughts of those who are in the last hours of life; the souls of the dying can be seen in their eyes.' This is what the sly jackal said to the gazelle, and the gazelle's heart swelled at the sound of those deceitful words. She came to the hollow lair of the beast, with no idea of what lay in store for her. The panther recklessly sprang up from his bed and launched a hasty attack, but he only managed to slash the gazelle's ears with his pointed claws as the wretched creature ran straight out the door and disappeared into the depths of the woods. The jackal wrung her hands in frustration, since her efforts had proved utterly futile. As for the panther, he groaned and chewed at thin air, equally beset by both hunger and despair. Once again he summoned the jackal and asked her to find yet another trick to use to catch the gazelle. The jackal plumbed the very depths of her cunning and then said, 'This is a difficult task indeed. But nevertheless I will carry out your command!' The jackal then set off after the gazelle, keen as a hound on the trail, devising elaborate traps and all kinds of mischief. Whenever she ran into a herdsman, the jackal would ask if he had happened to see a bleeding gazelle on the run. And when the herdsman had indeed caught a glimpse of the gazelle, he would point the jackal in the right direction. She finally found the gazelle concealed in the shade, where she had stopped to catch her breath. The jackal stood and stared at the gazelle, eyebrows raised, the very incarnation of shamelessness. A shiver ran down the gazelle's spine and her legs quivered as she angrily said to the jackal, 'Oh you abominable creature! If you dare to come near me or utter so much as a single word, you will live to regret it! Go find some other simpletons that you can outfox; pick someone else to be king and put him on the throne!' But the jackal was undaunted and said to the gazelle, 'Can you really be so mean spirited? So overcome by fear? So suspicious of your friends? The panther only wanted what was good for you! In an attempt to rouse you from your former idleness, he tugged at your ear, as a father might do on his deathbed. He wanted to bestow on you every precept you would need in order to take charge of such a kingdom, but you could not even withstand the touch of his feeble hand! Instead, you violently turned aside, inflicting a serious wound on yourself. As for the panther, at this moment he is even more upset than you are. Now that he has found you to be so untrustworthy and scatter-brained, he says that the hyena will be appointed king. Alas alack, what a wicked master he will be! What shall I do then? You are the one who has brought these evils upon all of us. But come, you must be more brave in the future and not let yourself be as easily frightened as some sheep from the flock. I swear these things to you by all the leaves on the trees and by every spring of water: I want to serve you and only you! There is nothing hostile about the panther's behaviour; his heartfelt wish is to make you queen of all the animals!' With these coaxing words, the jackal persuaded the tawny gazelle to enter once again into that very abode of death. As soon as the panther had the gazelle trapped in the depths of his den, he enjoyed a full course meal, greedily devouring the flesh of the gazelle, drinking the marrow from her bones and feasting on her entrails. The jackal, meanwhile, stood there waiting; after having delivered the gazelle, she was craving a share in the spoils. She stealthily grabbed the brains of the gazelle which had fallen to the ground and gobbled them up: this, then, was the booty which that sly boots got for her work. The panther, meanwhile, had made an inventory of all the gazelle's parts, and the brains were nowhere to be found. He searched around his couch and all over the house. Then the jackal confounded the truth of the matter and said, 'That gazelle had no brains, so don't waste your time looking for them. What kind of brains do you expect from a creature who would come not once but twice into the den of a panther?' Night follows day.",

His lair often hosted a large crowd of such animals, who gathered together in a company and treated one another with civility. The tiger would befriend and entertain them according to the rules of hospitality, placing before each of his guests their favourite dish, made with ingredients that the tiger knew would give them pleasure. There was a coyote who lived with the tiger as his friend and companion, and the two of them were very happy together. Meanwhile, an elderly baboon served as the carver at the feasts, distributing the portions of poultry to the tiger's guests at dinner. Whenever there was a guest who was not one of the regular party, the baboon would set before him the same portion which he offered his master, namely, the quarry that the tiger had seized in his latest hunting expedition. On these occasions, the coyote received leftovers from the day before, and less than her usual portion. One day the tiger happened to notice that the coyote was pointedly refusing to speak and that she refrained from the poultry served at dinner. The tiger asked her what was the matter. 'My wise coyote,' said the tiger, 'speak to me as you used to do! Cheer up and take part in the banquet, my dear.' But the coyote said, 'O tiger, best among all the species of beasts, I am sick at heart and deeply worried. It is not only the present situation that distresses me; I am also saddened by things which I see are yet to come. If some new guest arrives with every passing day, one after the other, this will become a matter of custom and soon I will not even have leftover poultry for my dinner.' What happens happens.",

It claimed to provide great satisfaction to mankind in terms of both convenience and delight. Meanwhile, the Well (said the Brook) passed obscurely through the subterranean tunnels, lay buried in lichen, and crept into the world as if ashamed to show its head. The Well was so offended by this arrogance and vanity that it stopped its spring and ceased the flow of its currents. As a result, the Brook's course dried up, leaving the salmon dead and rotting in the sludge. The day is the day.",
