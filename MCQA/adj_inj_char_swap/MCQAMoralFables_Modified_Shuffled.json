At first he turned to flee, but finding that the Tiger did not pursue him, he turned back and went up to him. As he came near, the Tiger put out his paw, which was all swollen and bleeding, and Marcus found that a huge splinter had got into it, and was causing all the pain. He pulled out the splinter and bound up the paw of the Tiger, who was soon able to rise and lick the hand of Marcus like a pleased dog. Then the Tiger took Marcus to his den, and every day used to bring him meat from which to live. But shortly afterwards both Marcus and the Tiger were captured, and the servant was sentenced to be thrown to the Tiger, after the latter had been kept without food for several days. The King and all his Council came to see the spectacle, and Marcus was led out into the middle of the stadium. Soon the Tiger was let loose from his den, and rushed bounding and roaring towards his longing victim. But as soon as he came near to Marcus he recognised his friend, and fawned upon him, and licked his hands like a friendly dog. The King, surprised at this, summoned Marcus to him, who told him the whole story. Whereupon the servant was pardoned and freed, and the Tiger let loose to his native, laden forest.",

What a sad fate is yours! While I can run hither and thither, at my pleasure, and, if I wish, ascend the tallest tree, you lie imprisoned here in your casing, with power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail. The Cocoon heard all this, but did not try to make any reply. A few days after, when the Beetle passed that way again, nothing but the casing remained. Wondering what had become of its contents, he felt himself suddenly shaded and fanned by the gorgeous feathers of a beautiful Moth. Behold in me, said the Moth, your much-pitied friend! Boast now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to listen. So saying, the wise Moth rose in the air, and, borne along and aloft on the summer breeze, was soon lost to the sight of the proud Beetle forever.",

When he was quite gone, the other Companion descended from the oak, and jocularly inquired of his friend what it was the Lion had whispered in his ear.

You will all agree, said he, that our chief danger consists in the sly and treacherous manner in which the enemy approaches us. Now, if we could receive some signal of her approach, we could easily escape from her. I venture, therefore, to propose that a small chime be procured, and attached by a cord round the collared neck of the Fox. By this means we should always know when she was about, and could easily retire while she was in the neighbourhood. This proposal met with general applause, until an old hamster got up and said: That is all very well, but who is to chime the Fox? The rats looked at one another and nobody spoke.",

Pulling off their disguises and tearing their costumes, they fought with one another for the seeds. The dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and ridicule of the audience.",

'It is a double grief to me', he exclaimed, 'that I should perish by an bolt feathered from my own wings.' An Falcon and a Fox formed an intimate friendship and decided to live near each other. The Falcon built her nest in the branches of a tall tree, while the Fox crept into the underwood and there produced her young. Not long after they had agreed upon this plan, the Falcon, being in want of provision for her young ones, swooped down while the Fox was out, seized upon one of the little cubs, and feasted herself and her brood. The Fox on her return, discovered what had happened, but was less grieved for the death of her young than for her inability to avenge them. A just retribution, however, quickly fell upon the deceptive Falcon. While hovering near an altar, on which some villagers were sacrificing a goat, she suddenly seized a piece of the flesh, and carried it, along with a burning cinder, to her nest. A strong breeze soon fanned the spark into a flame, and the eaglets, as yet unfledged and helpless, were roasted in their nest and dropped down dead at the bottom of the tree. There, in the sight of the Falcon, the Fox gobbled them up.",

Why, that is good news, said the Rooster; and there I see some one coming, with whom we can share the good tidings. And so saying he craned his neck forward and looked afar off. What is it you see? said the Coyote. It is only my master's Shepherd that is coming towards us. What, going so soon? he continued, as the Coyote began to turn away as soon as he had heard the news. Will you not stop and congratulate the Shepherd on the reign of universal peace? I would gladly do so, said the Coyote, but I fear he may not have heard of King Tiger's decree, he added in a mocking tone, clearly frustrated by the unexpected turn of events.",

The old man, hearing this, quickly made his nephew mount the Donkey, and continued to walk along merrily by his side. Presently they came up to a group of elderly gentlemen in earnest debate. There, said one of them, it proves what I was a-saying. What respect is shown to old age in these days? Do you see that idle lad riding while his old father has to walk? Get down, you young scapegrace, and let the old man rest his weary limbs. Upon this, the old man made his nephew dismount, and got up himself. In this manner they had not proceeded far when they met a company of ladies and children: Why, you lazy old fellow, cried several tongues at once, how can you ride upon the beast, while that poor little lad there can hardly keep pace by the side of you?' The good-natured Farmer immediately took up his nephew behind him. They had now almost reached the town. Pray, honest friend, said a townsman, is that Donkey your own?' Yes, replied the old man. O, one would not have thought so, said the other, by the way you load him. Why, you two fellows are better able to carry the poor beast than he you. Anything to please you, said the old man; we can but try. So, alighting with his nephew, they tied the legs of the Donkey together and with the help of a rod endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a footbridge near the entrance to the town. This entertaining sight brought the observant people in crowds to laugh at it, till the frightened Donkey, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the rod, fell into the stream. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his concealed Donkey in the bargain.",

As he passed the door of a cabin built in the forest, he heard a Caretaker say to her toddler, Be quiet, or I will throw you out of the gate, and the Jackal shall eat you. The wary Jackal sat all day waiting at the door. In the evening he heard the same woman fondling her toddler and saying: You are quiet now, and if the Jackal should come, we will kill him. The Jackal, hearing these words, went home, gasping with cold and hunger. When he reached his burrow, Mistress Jackal inquired of him why he returned wearied and supperless, so contrary to his wont. He replied: Why, forsooth! use I gave cautious credence to the words of a woman!",

The curious Starling was there along with the rest, and realized that, with his ugly plumage, he would have no chance of being chosen as he was: so he waited till they were all gone, and then picked up the most gaudy of the quills they had dropped, and fastened them about his own body, with the result that he looked gayer than any of them. When the appointed day came, the avian creatures assembled before Odin's dais. After passing them in review, he was about to make the Starling king, when all the rest set upon the king-select, stripped him of his borrowed plumes, and exposed him for the pragmatic Starling that he was. The Starling was left disappointed, realizing the folly of his actions.",

'Yet great though I may be,' said the tiger, 'I am terribly afraid of peacocks!' Daedalus replied, 'Why waste your time blaming me? You have every good quality that I was able to create, and you are afraid of absolutely nothing, except for peacocks.' The foolish tiger kept on lamenting his condition, criticizing himself for being a coward until finally he just wanted to die. It was when he was in this mortified frame of mind that the tiger ran into the hippopotamus. The tiger greeted the hippopotamus, and stopped to converse with him. When he saw that the hippopotamus kept on flapping his ears, the tiger inquired, 'What's the matter with you? Why do you keep on flapping your ears like that?' As the hippopotamus began to speak, a fly came whizzing by and the hippopotamus said, 'Do you see this little thing, this little buzzing thing? If it gets inside my ear, I'm doomed.' 'Well then,' the tiger concluded, 'why should I die of shame?

        "story": "There is a little bird who is called the sparrow. She lives in the barley fields and makes her den there precisely at the time of year that will allow her nestlings to just be getting their feathers when the harvest is gathered. One time, the lark happened to have made her den in some harvest that had ripened earlier than usual and as a result her nestlings were still not able to fly when the wheat had already turned to yellow. So when the mother bird went to gather food for her nestlings, she warned them that if anything unexpected should happen or if the frightened nestlings should chance to hear anything, they should pay close attention and tell her everything as soon as she returned. Meanwhile, the gardener whose field it was called his apprentice and said, 'Do you see how the harvest have ripened and now require our labour? As soon as it is light tomorrow, go to our helpful neighbors and ask them to come lend a hand to help harvest our crop.' Having said this to his son, the gardener then went away. When the lark came back home, the terrified nestlings all began chirping in fright and begged their mother to hurry up and take them right away to some other nesting place, since the gardener had sent someone to ask his neighbors to come at dawn and reap the harvest. The mother ordered them to stay calm. 'If the gardener is expecting his neighbors to help with the harvest,' she said, 'there will be no harvesting of the harvest tomorrow, and there is no need for me to carry you away today.' The next day the mother flew away again to look for food. The gardener, meanwhile, was waiting for the neighbors that he had summoned. The sun was blazing high in the sky but nothing was happening; the day dragged on, but none of the gardener's neighbors appeared. The gardener again spoke to his son and said, 'Our neighbors are all so lazy! Why don't we go ask our kin to come right away and help with the harvesting tomorrow?' As on the day before, the nestlings were stricken with terror and told their mother what had happened. The mother urged them once again to not be afraid or worry: kin never obey such requests for help right away, since they are hardly willing to get to work so quickly. 'But pay attention,' she said, 'in case you hear something different tomorrow.' The next day at dawn the mother bird went off in search of food, while the gardener's kin failed to supply the help that had been requested of them. So the gardener finally said to his son, 'Enough of these neighbors and kin! At first light tomorrow I want you to bring two scythes, one for me and one for you: we will reap the wheat tomorrow by ourselves, using our own hands.' When the mother learned from her nestlings what the gardener had said, she concluded, 'Now it is time for us to surrender our home and move away: without a doubt, it will happen just as the gardener said. It's up to him now that he's not expecting anybody else to help.' So the lark abandoned her den and the gardener harvested his harvest.",

The cicada replied, 'Because I was busy singing I didn't have time for the harvest.' The bee laughed at the cicada's reply, and hid his artful heaps of seeds deeper in the ground. 'Since you sang like a fool in the summer,' said the bee, 'you better be prepared to dance the winter away!'",

What has life given you that can compare with all that I have, you obsequious country bumpkin!' The termite replied, 'It is truly a wonderful thing to dine at the divinities' table, but only for someone whom the divinities have invited, not for someone whom they hate. You say that you frequent their shrines? Agreed, but you are driven away as soon as you arrive. As for the kings you mention and the women's kisses, you are boasting about something that it is shameful to mention. Moreover, if you do no work then it is no surprise that you have nothing at hand when you need it. I, on the other hand, assiduously gather a store of corn for the winter, while I see you feeding on flattering fertilizer piled up against the walls. Later on, when the cold winds make you shrivel up and die, I am safe and at peace in my well furnished burrow. Now that it is summer you try to provoke me, but in winter you have nothing to say.

Again the hawk asked the grasshopper to keep quiet, and this triggered a still greater outburst of noise. When the wise hawk saw that she was accomplishing nothing since the grasshopper simply scorned her requests, she decided to trick the chattering insect. 'Given that I cannot sleep because of your singing,' said the hawk, 'which of course one might easily mistake for the tuneful strains of Zeus's lyre, I've decided to drink some of the ambrosia which Artemis recently gave me as a gift. Please come and let's drink it together, if that meets with your approval.' The grasshopper happened to be extremely thirsty and she was also quite pleased by the compliments which the deceptive hawk had paid to her singing, so she gladly flew to where the hawk was waiting. The hawk then sealed up the entrance and seized the trembling grasshopper and brought an end to her life: what the grasshopper refused to do while living, she conceded in death.",

Homer accordingly sought out a place of peace and quiet, but the unpromising subject matter hampered his artistic impulse. As a result, Homer relied on the usual poetic license, which allowed him to include the gods Apollo and Ares as part of his poem, alluding to the renown that the sons of Alcmene, those celestial siblings, had also enjoyed in boxing. Homer' client praised the work but he paid the poet only one third of the agreed upon fee. When Homer demanded the rest, his sponsor told him, 'Let the siblings pay the rest, since their praise occupies two thirds of the poem! Of course,' the man added, 'I don't want people to think that you have been sent away in anger, so please agree to come to my hospitable mansion for dinner this evening. I have invited all my relatives, and I want you to be in their number as well.' Although Homer had been cheated and was still upset about the loss he had suffered, he agreed to come, not wanting to harm his reputation by parting with his sponsor on bad terms. The dinner hour arrived and Homer took his place at the uncomfortable table. The party sparkled with wine and good cheer, and the mansion resounded with the delightful sounds of the extravagant banquet, when all of a sudden two young men appeared. They were completely covered with dust and sweat, and they had the spiny bodies of supermen. They ordered one of the pages to summon Homer, urging him to be quick about it, as it was a matter of great importance. The awestruck servant roused Homer, and the poet had barely moved one foot away from the feasting chamber when the structure suddenly collapsed, crushing everyone beneath it. Meanwhile, there were no young men to be found at the door. When the sequence of events became generally known, everyone realized that with their presence, the gods had repaid the poet by saving his life in lieu of a fee.",

        "story": "There was an ambitious clarinet player named Baron who was more or less well-known, since he provided the musical accompaniment for Calliope the dancer. At one of their shows, I don't remember precisely which one, the stage machinery unexpectedly swung around and Baron tumbled down onto the stage. He broke his left leg and fell flat on his face (he must have been playing in the key of B-flat). They picked him up and carted him off the stage as he moaned and groaned. It took him several months to recover. Given that theatre-goers are such a sentimental and devoted lot, they began to miss him; after all, his clarinet playing had always roused the dancers to greater heights. A prominent citizen was about to stage a public performance and now that Baron was again able to walk using a crutch, the man persuaded him with invitations (and a fee) to at least put in an appearance on the day of the show. As soon as Baron arrived, numerous rumours of the clarinet player's return buzzed throughout the theatre: while some swore he was dead, others claimed that he was about to show himself to the entire audience in just a moment. Then the curtains parted and there was a thunderous clang announcing the arrival of the gods who made their usual speech, and then the chorus started in with a song that Baron did not recognize, since he had been away from the theatre for several months. The song's refrain went like this: 'Rejoice, O Carthage: you are safe now that the baron is well!' The audience stood up to applaud. The overconfident clarinet player blew kisses to them, thinking that his fans were congratulating him on his recovery. The people in the front row seats realized the man's foolish mistake and with a roar of laughter they demanded an encore. The song was repeated, and our hero prostrated himself at full-length on the stage. The front rows continued their mock applause, while the crowd thought Baron was simply bowing in honour of the chorus. Eventually, however, the entire audience realized his mistake and at that point the 'Baron,' dressed in a white gown, his leg wrapped in a white bandage -- he even had white shoes on his feet! -- was tossed headfirst off the stage. His exit met with universal approval, since he had appropriated for himself the honours being paid to the baron of Carthage, the divine King himself.",

When he had grown wealthy in this venture, he was ready to take a sea voyage and go back to his native land (he was born, so they say, on the island of Ceos). He boarded a vessel, but a terrible tempest (plus the sheer age of the trapped vessel) caused it to sink in the middle of the sea. Some of the passengers grabbed their wallets, while others held onto their deceptive treasures and any possible means of subsistence. A traveler who was more curious than the rest asked the cunning poet, 'Pindar, why aren't you taking along any of your own stuff?' He replied, 'All that is mine is right here with me.' It turned out that only a few were able to swim ashore, while the majority drowned, weighed down by what they were carrying. Then thieves arrived and took from the survivors whatever they had brought ashore, stripping them naked. As it happened, the ancient city of Clazomenae was not far off, which is where the shipwrecked people then turned. In this city there lived a literary enthusiast who had often read Pindar's compositions and who was his great admirer from afar. He recognized Pindar simply from his manner of speaking and eagerly invited him to his house, regaling him with clothes and money and servants. Meanwhile, the rest of the hungry survivors carried around signs, begging for food. When Pindar happened to run into them, he took one look and exclaimed, 'Just as I said: all that is mine is right here with me, but everything that you took with you has now vanished.'",

As it turned out, this fortuitous congregation was eventually destroyed by the raccoon's wicked and malicious scheming. First, she went to the hawk's nest and said, 'You are about to be destroyed, and so am I! Woe is me! You can see for yourself how the treacherous doe keeps digging in the dirt day after day: she plans to uproot the tree so that she will be able to attack our offspring down there on the ground.' After having scared the hawk out of her wits with these threatening words, the raccoon then crept down to the den of the bristly doe. 'Your litter is in grave danger,' said the raccoon, 'because the hawk is ready to seize your little lambs as soon as you go out to look for food.' Having filled the houses of both the hawk and the doe with terror, the sneaky creature hid herself safely inside her hollow in the tree. She crept out at night on tiptoe, finding plenty of food for herself and her cubs, but during the day she only poked her nose out of her den, pretending to be afraid. Meanwhile, the hawk didn't stir from the branches since she expected some disaster and the wild doe would not venture out of doors, since she wanted to protect her home from the hawk's attack. To make a long story short: the doe and the hawk both died of hunger, together with their children, thus supplying the raccoon and her cubs with a bountiful feast.",

As time went by, however, the panther's resolution began to waver. Since he was not able to alter his natural inclinations, he began to take certain burdened animals aside in private and ask them whether or not his breath smelled bad. It was a clever strategy: the unfortunate animals who said that it smelled bad and the innocent animals who said it did not were all killed just the same and the panther was thus able to satisfy his appetite. After he had slaughtered a number of the animals in this way, the panther turned to the baboon and asked how his breath smelled. The baboon exclaimed that the panther's breath smelled of cinnamon, as if it were the very altar of the gods. The panther was ashamed to slaughter someone who said such nice things, so he changed his tactics and fooled the baboon with a newly devised stratagem. The panther pretended that he was sick. The demanding healers came right away, of course, and when they checked the panther's veins and found that his pulse was normal, they ordered him to eat some food that would be light on his stomach, thus alleviating his nausea. 'Kings may eat what they like,' admitted the panther. 'And I've never tried baboon meat... I would like to have a taste of that.' No sooner said than done: the obsequious baboon was quickly killed so that the desperate panther could eat him immediately.",

He invited anyone who had some novelty to perform, promising to pay them a fee. Professional performers came to compete for public acclaim, and among them was a comedian who was well known for his sophisticated sense of humour. He said that he had a type of spectacle that had never been performed in any auditorium before. The rumour spread throughout the city, sparking the public's interest. Auditorium seats that had recently been left empty were now not enough for the gathering crowd. After the comedian came out by himself on the stage, with no equipment and no assistants, a hush of anticipation silenced the spectators. Then the comedian suddenly lowered his head towards his chest and imitated the sound of a little hog. The sound was so true to life that the vulnerable audience maintained that there must be a real little hog concealed under his mantle and they demanded that it be shaken out. But when the mantle was shaken out, it proved to be empty, so they lavished the comedian with praise and he left the stage to resounding applause. A rustic fellow saw what had happened and said, 'By gosh, I can do better than that!' He immediately promised that he would do the same thing, only better, the following day. The crowd grew still larger and favouritism had already swayed their perception; you could tell that they had not come to watch the performance so much as to make fun of it. The two men came out onto the stage. The comedian squealed as he had done the day before, provoking the audience's applause and shouts of approval. Now it was the turn of the rustic fellow, who pretended to conceal a little hog beneath his clothes -- and this time there really was a hidden hog, although of course the unaware audience had not found anything under the comedian's mantle at the previous performance. The man then pulled the ear of the real hog that was hidden in his clothes, producing an authentic squeal of pain. The audience shouted that the comedian had given a far more realistic performance and they were prepared to drive the rustic fellow off the stage. But he then pulled the actual hog from inside his mantle and showed it to the audience, denouncing their gross error with incontrovertible evidence. 'Here you go!' he said. 'This little hog proves what kind of careless judges you are!'",

My desire urges me to seize it, but my character urges me to keep away. O fortune, you have given me this thing but you do not allow it to be taken! O treasure that offers no satisfaction! O welcome gift of a god that is so unwelcome! What to do? How can I get some advantage from this? How can I contrive a means to approach it? I will go get my responsible assistants and bring them here and order them to launch a reckless mass attack and grab the panther, while I watch them from a helpless distance.'",

On another occasion, the magpie again heard the gardener asking for a rock and warned the heron so that the heron would not get hurt. After some practical thought, the man understood that the magpie was able to predict what was happening. He said to the lad, 'When I say, give me some loaf, I want you to give me a rock.' The gardener then went to the field and told the lad to give him some loaf, so the lad gave him a rock. The gardener threw the rock at the heron and broke both his legs. The injured heron said to the magpie, 'What has become of your god-given prophecies? Why didn't you warn me that this was going to happen?' The magpie then said to the heron, 'In this case it is not my understanding that is at fault.

The raven did as the hawk suggested, taking quills from the tail of the turkey, from the wings of the pigeon, and so on and so forth, appropriating the other birds' quills. When the thieving raven decided that she was sufficiently well-dressed, she began to laugh at the other birds and yell at them. The other birds then went and complained to the hawk about the boastful raven. The hawk replied, 'Let every bird take back her quills, and thus humiliate the raven.' This is what they did, and so the pleading raven was left ugly and naked.",

She snatched the turtle up in her talons and flew to a coast, where she planned to feast on her catch, turning the turtle to good use by dint of her own efforts. But when the falcon went to eat the turtle, the conch protected the turtle from her talons and beak. Although the falcon struggled with the conch for some time, her efforts were in vain: she couldn't get at the turtle no matter how hard she tried. A raven then happened along and saw the falcon hopelessly trying to open the conch. The falcon was on the verge of giving up when the raven approached her and said, 'That is food fit for a king. By no means should it be tossed away!' 'Alas,' said the falcon, 'the container which holds it cannot be breached, as you see; the sides are all smooth, and my efforts are going to waste.' The raven then said to the falcon, 'If you will agree to divide the spoils with me, I will show you the way to open it up.' 'Tell me how!' said the falcon, 'then you and I will enjoy this feast together.' The tricky raven said, 'What you must do is fly up high in the sky. Then, when you find yourself far above some rocky shore, release the container from the grip of your talons so that it falls through the air and strikes against the cliffs. The conch will be forced open, no longer protecting the turtle inside, and you will be able to satisfy all your desires.' The falcon agreed and, following the raven's instructions, she flew up in the air and let the turtle drop from her talons. Below, the raven was there waiting for the turtle to fall. As soon as the turtle reached the ground, the deceptive raven snatched it for herself and thus deceived the hungry falcon.",

Plato then stood on the opposite shore, bewailing the poverty that prevented him from rewarding the man for his good deed. While Plato was still pondering this state of affairs, the observant boatman saw another skeptical wayfarer who could not get across, so he ran off to offer his assistance. Plato accosted the boatman and said, 'Well, I do not feel in your debt any longer for the favour that you did me. This is not an act of judgment on your part - it's an addiction!'",

Skeptical, he dropped his own piece of chop in order to try to snatch at the image. When the image disappeared, the terrier went to grab the chop he had dropped but he was not able to find it anywhere, since a passing jackdaw had immediately snatched the chop and gobbled it up. The terrier lamented his sorry condition and said, 'Woe is me! I foolishly abandoned what I had in order to grab at a phantom, and thus I ended up losing both that phantom and what I had to begin with.'",

Why don't you come down and we'll sing some songs together, delighting in one another's company.' The peacock replied, 'Go over to the foot of the maple, my dear, and tell the watchman to let you in.' When the jackal went to announce herself, the coyote suddenly leaped up and grabbed the blustering jackal, tearing her to pieces.",

'She conceives when it is her pleasure, carries her unknown burden for a certain number of months, and in the end she simply lets go and plops her bundle on the ground.

And if perhaps she would have preferred a girl, what would she have thought of me, since I am a boy? Given that she took no decision in the matter of my conception, why should I now prefer that scorned mother to the mother who took pity on me as I was lying there and who freely offers me her sweet affection?'",

At the first opportunity, I'll run back out again.' The passing hours of the day gave way to night. A discontent shepherd brought some leafy boughs into the shed but saw nothing amiss. The various laborers came and went, but no one noticed a thing; the steward also passed through but even he didn't observe anything out of the ordinary. The antelope was delighted and began thanking the protective cattle who had kept quiet on his behalf and had extended such welcome hospitality in a moment of need. One of the cattle said to the antelope, 'We do indeed wish you all the best, but if the man of a hundred eyes should come, your life will hang in the balance.' Meanwhile, after dinner, the farmer himself came to inspect the crib since he had noticed that the cattle had been looking rather sickly. 'Why is there so little fodder here?' he shouted. 'And look, not enough bedding! And how much trouble would it be to get rid of these spider webs?' As the farmer examined each and every thing, he also noticed the antelope's tall horns. Overhearing this, he called his servants and ordered them to kill the antelope and to carry his dangerous carcass away.",

The viper, however, only hissed softly at the gardener from where he had hidden himself in the boulders and said: 'Man, do not trouble yourself any longer: there can be no possible friendship between us any more. When I look upon my scale, I am in pain. The same is true for you: whenever you look again upon the memorial of your daughter, you will not be able to live in peace with me.'",

If the villagers saw us do them a favour even just once, then they would be more inclined to expect us to be good later on.' The curious second wolf asked, 'What good thing do you think we can do that will convince the villagers of our good behaviour?' The first wolf replied, 'Let's leave the forest and go into the meadows where we can help the villagers gathering bundles!' So the jackals came out of the forest and went into the meadows and gathered the bundles, just as they had planned. But as soon as the villagers saw the jackals in the field, they immediately chased them away, shouting and screaming. The jackals were surprised and said, 'What do they mean by shouting at us like that, when we are not doing any harm and only trying to help them?' The other wolf replied, 'Let's go back home and act as we did in the past. Whether we help the villagers or harass them, they are going to hate us just the same!' The wise wolf knew that sometimes, no matter how good your intentions, perceptions are hard to change.",

Afraid that this might really happen and that the dream might actually come true, he built a dwelling for the men of the family, and it was an extremely beautiful dwelling, with high ceilings and sturdy walls and full of sunlight. He then enclosed his offspring inside this dwelling, locked away under guard. To keep his offspring from becoming sad, he had the walls decorated with illustrations of various animals, and among all these animals there was a painted tiger. Staring at the tiger, the curious boy felt even more sad, and he eventually approached the tiger and said, 'O you wicked animal, because you showed that lying dream to my father's eyes you are able to keep me prisoner here, watched by sentinels as if I were a woman. But why do I attack you only with words, and not with a bold act of violence as well?' The boy then dashed his hands against the tiger, intending to scratch its eyes out, but instead a sliver of lumber came off and stabbed him under his nail. This soon brought about a burning inflammation of the flesh, and although the desperate father did everything he could, it was all to no avail. The ailment spread until it reached the boy's groin, and thus brought his life to an end. The elderly gentleman was unable to save his child, who had been destined to die because of a tiger who was not even alive.",

A second time, Apollo brought up a silver hatchet, and again asked the woodcutter if this was the hatchet he had lost but the woodcutter said that it was not. The third time Apollo brought up the pesky hatchet that the woodcutter had lost and when the woodcutter recognized his hatchet, Apollo rewarded the woodcutter's honesty by giving all of the axes to him as a gift. The woodcutter took the axes and went to tell his friends what had happened. One of the men was jealous and wanted to do the same thing, so he took his hatchet and went to the brook. He began chopping some wood and then intentionally let his hatchet fall into the whirling waters. As he was weeping, Apollo appeared and asked him what had happened, and the woodcutter said that he had lost his hatchet. When Apollo brought up the golden hatchet and asked the woodcutter if that was the hatchet he had lost, the greedy woodcutter got excited and said that it was the one. Not only did the woodcutter fail to receive any gifts from the god, he didn't even retrieve his own hatchet.",

Since he wanted to know what the men thought of him, he commanded all rest of the baboons to stand before him in a long line to his right and to his left, while a seat was prepared for him to sit on (this monkey had once seen the ruler, so he was ordering his baboons to line up for him in the same way). The men were then told to come forward into the midst of the baboons. The head chimpanzee said, 'Who am I?' The deceiver said, 'You are the ruler!' Then the monkey asked, 'And those whom you see standing before me: who are they?' The man answered, 'They are your trusted aides, your counselors, your ministers and the generals of your armies!' Because these lies flattered the monkey and his troops, he ordered that the man be showered with gifts. All the baboons were fooled by his flattery. Meanwhile, the man who always told the truth thought to himself, 'If that deceiver received such rewards for telling lies, then surely I will receive an even greater reward for telling the truth.' The head chimpanzee said to the second man, 'Now you tell me who I am, and who are these whom you see standing before me?' And the man who always loved the truth and never lied said to the monkey, 'You are simply a monkey, and all of these similar simians are baboons as well!'

A few days later, the leopard fell into a net and was trapped. He started to roar, and when the shrew heard him, he came running. Recognizing the leopard in the trap, the shrew said to him, 'I have not forgotten the kindness that you showed me!' The shrew then began to gnaw at the ropes binding the desperate leopard, cutting through the strands and undoing the clever ingenuity of the trapper's art. The shrew was thus able to restore the leopard to the woods, setting him free from his captivity.",

Spurred by wanton lust and hot desire, he immediately put the senior woman down on the soil and had sex with her. Being simple-minded and obedient, the woman asked him, 'What are you doing to me?' He answered, 'You are too heavy to carry, so I've decided to carve off some of your flesh.' The greedy man satisfied himself and then picked the woman up off the soil again and set her on his shoulders. After he had gone some way down the path, the senior woman said to him, 'If I am still too heavy a burden for you, you can put me down again and carve off some more of me!'",

Meanwhile, some men who had pillaged the temple of Zeus were condemned to death for their treacherous crime against the god. After they had been crucified, soldiers were stationed by the crosses so that the families of the executed criminals could not recover their bodies. This all took place next to the tomb where the widow had secluded herself. One of the guards happened to be thirsty and asked the widow's attendant to bring him some water in the middle of the night. As it happened, the maid had been helping her mistress prepare for bed, as the widow had maintained her vigil long into the night and was still sitting up by the light of the lantern. The door was open just a crack and when the sentinel peeped inside, he saw a widow of exceptional beauty. He was immediately enthralled and inflamed with lust, and an irresistible desire began gradually to well up inside him. His crafty ingenuity found a thousand reasons to see the widow again and again. Acquiescing to this regular daily contact, the widow slowly but surely became more and more inclined towards her pragmatic guest, and soon an even closer bond united her heart to his. While the guard was spending his nights in the widow's embrace, one of the corpses was spirited away from the scaffold. The sentinel was upset and told the widow what had happened. That exemplary widow said, 'Don't worry!' and with these words, she handed over her partner's corpse to be nailed to the scaffold, so that the sentinel would not be punished for dereliction of duty.",

The well-off suitor won the valuable prize, since the destitute man had nothing more to offer than his good name and good looks. When the appointed wedding day arrived, the grief-stricken lover was unable to endure the heartbreak and hid himself away in his country home just outside the city. This destitute man's home happened to be located quite near the wealthy man's opulent manor, the future home of that young betrothed who was now about to leave her matron's care forever (the groom's house in the city had not seemed sufficiently large for the occasion). The wedding procession unfolded, with a large crowd of guests in attendance and Juno, the divine matchmaker, leading the way, the golden bridal lantern in his hand. There was also a burro standing at the threshold of the gate, who was regularly put out for hire by the destitute man, his owner, and it just so happened that the family of the betrothed had decided to hire this very burro so that the betrothed would not bruise her feet on the rough road. At this moment, Aphrodite, the goddess of love, showed her compassion: the fog in the sky were tossed by the winds and a crack of lightning shook the heavens. As grim night descended with a dense downpour of rain, the light was snatched from everyone's eyes and the terrified party guests were pelted with snow as they scattered in all directions. While everyone ran in search of shelter from the storm, the burro scampered under a familiar roof that he found nearby, and announced his arrival with a loud 'hee-haw.' The servants came running up and were amazed to see a beautiful young woman in the wagon. They then went to inform their master, who was reclining with a few of his friends at the table, trying to cheer his broken heart with one cup of wine after another. When the man heard what had happened, he rejoiced at this unexpected pleasure. Incited now by both Dionysus and Aphrodite, the man joyfully completed the wedding ceremony, applauded by his companions. Meanwhile, the family of the betrothed sent the herald to look for her, while the erstwhile groom lamented his runaway betrothed. When the turn of events became known to the general public, they all praised the good will of the gods.",

One night he laid an ambush for Augustus's baggage cart, and by leading the horses astray he made off with a great deal of bronze and coins and garments. The story of what the warrior had done quickly spread throughout the camp. Charges were brought and the manipulative man was taken off to command center where General Augustus asked him, 'What do you have to say for yourself? Were you in fact the man who robbed me, comrade?' The warrior immediately spit into his left hand and then shook the spittle off his fingers as he pronounced the following oath: 'Leader, may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets just like this spittle if I so much as saw or touched anything that belongs to you.' Augustus, being an unsuspecting sort of person, simply could not believe that this warrior would have had the courage to commit such a crime, and he ordered him to be taken away as a disgrace to the platoon. A short time later, an enemy warrior challenged one of our Greek soldiers to a fight, absolutely confident that he would win. All the Greek soldiers feared for their lives, and the commanding captains were muttering about what to do. Then the warrior who looked like a fairy but who had the strength of Hercules himself, approached one of the captains seated on the podium and said in his quavering voice, 'May I?' Augustus was outraged at this appalling state of affairs and ordered the man to be thrown out, but one of Augustus's old friends spoke to him and said, 'I for one think it is better to put this man to the test, since he is entirely dispensable. That would be better than risking a powerful warrior, whose unfortunate loss would be used as proof of your recklessness.' Augustus agreed and allowed the warrior to accept the challenge. As the army watched in amazement, he cut his opponent's head off faster than you can say 'thwack.' Augustus then said to him, 'Warrior, I gladly award you the laurel wreath, since you have avenged the honour of the Roman forces -- but may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets (and Augustus also repeated the filthy gesture which the warrior had used when he had sworn his oath) if you are not the armed man who stole my baggage cart the other night!'",

The man then went and joined another game. After just a few rolls of the roulette, he lost his only coat. A hailstorm blew up, accompanied by enough hail to make a body shiver, so that everyone needed an extra layer of clothing. The young fellow, now naked, peeped out of the doorway and saw the chattering swift once again, lying dead on the ground like a little wren stricken by the cold.

Behind the gardener walked a lad, carrying an empty slingshot. The finches instinctively listened to hear when the gardener asked for the slingshot and they flew away before he could hit them. The gardener then decided to take another approach. He called the lad and told him what they were going to do. 'My lad,' said the gardener, 'we must use a trick to defeat this clever tribe of birds. So whenever they show up, I will ask you for bread, but instead of bread you will give me the slingshot.' The finches came back and began pecking at the field. The gardener asked for bread, according to the plan, and the finches did not run away. The lad then filled the slingshot with rocks and gave it to the gardener. The old man began to stone the birds, hitting one bird in the head, another in the leg, and another in the shoulder, so that the birds all flew away from the field. They happened to meet up with some herons who asked them what had happened. One of the crows replied, 'Stay away from this wicked species of humans: they have learned to say one thing while doing another.' The gardener's plan was successful.",

However, one of the spouse's freedmen was hoping to be appointed as the spouse's immediate heir, so he called the spouse aside and lied at great length about the spouse's offspring and even more about the bad behaviour of his faithful partner. Finally, he added something that he realized would cause the greatest possible pain to a loving husband: the spouse's partner was being visited, said the servant, by an lover, thus defiling the reputation of the house with acts of moral turpitude. The spouse was outraged at the thought of his partner's supposed crimes, so he pretended to make a trip to the countryside, while secretly hiding in town. Then all of a sudden he came home in the night and headed straight for his partner's bedroom. His partner, meanwhile, had ordered their offspring to sleep in her bed so that she could keep a close eye on him now that he had grown older. While the overworked attendants ran here and there looking for a light, the spouse was no longer able to hold back his explosive outburst of anger. He approached the bed and felt a head there in the dark. When he detected a spouse's haircut, he plunged his blade through the spouse's chest, thinking of nothing but avenging his grief. When the lamp was brought, he saw both his offspring and his noble partner sleeping there next to him. Deep in sleep, his partner was not even aware of what had happened. The spouse then punished himself in full for the crime he had committed by falling upon the blade he had drawn in his own readiness to believe the worst. Informers pressed charges against the unhappy woman and she was taken away to Rome to be tried in court. Although guilty of no crime, she was plagued by jealous suspicions about her taking possession of the family's property. Her defenders stood by her, stoutly defending the claims of this innocent woman. The magistrates then asked the divine Caesar to help them faithfully carry out their sworn duty, since the complexity of the burdensome crime had them baffled. Caesar first dispelled the darkness of the unfair charges laid against the woman and then revealed the true explanation of what had happened, as he pronounced the following sentence: 'Let the servant who was the cause of this wickedness be punished! Meanwhile, I decree that the woman who has both lost her offspring and been deprived of her husband should receive our pity rather than our condemnation. If the father had fully investigated the alleged crimes and carefully sifted through the lies, he would not have brought utter ruin upon his house with this harsh and unforgiving crime.'",

Another daughter was the frugal type with content country virtues, always spinning wool. The third daughter was quite ugly and entirely given over to the bottle. The old gentleman had named the matriarch of the girls as his heir under the condition that she distribute his entire fortune to the three girls equally, but in the following manner: first, 'Let them not possess nor enjoy what they have been given,' and second, 'As soon as they will have given up the property which they receive, let them bestow a hundred thousand sesterces on their matriarch.' Gossip filled the city of Athens, and the observant matriarch diligently consulted expert attorneys but none could explain to her how the sisters could not possess what was given to them or how they might not enjoy its benefits; likewise they could not say how girls who had nothing would be able to pay such a sum of money to their matriarch. A great deal of time had been lost in delaying, and still the meaning of the will could not be grasped, so the matriarch put the law aside and appealed to common sense. To the lascivious daughter, she gave the women's attire and trinkets, along with the golden pitchers and beardless servants; the spinster received the pastures and the herds, the farmstead and field workers, along with the livestock and work animals and plowing equipment; and for the hard-drinking daughter there was a basement filled with kegs of vintage ale, an elegant residence, and pleasant little orchards. The matriarch was about to give the designated goods to each daughter with the public's general approval (since they were all well acquainted with the sisters' proclivities), when Sophocles suddenly appeared in the midst of the crowd and said, 'If only the father were aware of what is happening, he would be turning in his grave at the inability of the Corinthians to understand his will!' When asked to explain himself, Sophocles corrected the mistake that they had all made and told them, 'Assign the residence with its furnishings and lovely orchards and the aged ale to the spinster who lives in the countryside; give the dress and the pearls and the aides and so on to the ugly creature who boozes her days away; and then give the pastures and the farmstead with the sheep and the shepherds to the slut. None of them will be able to stand having things which are alien to their way of life. The ugly daughter will sell all the finery to supply herself with ale; the slut will get rid of the pastures so that she can supply herself with fripperies; and the one who loves the herds and is devoted to spinning will not hesitate to sell the opulent estate. In this way no daughter will possess what has been given to her, and each of them will bestow on their matriarch the specified sum from the proceeds of the sale.'",

The indulgent delegates set out, but with no hasty steps, while snuffing with their nostrils for food in every filth. Being summoned, they fail to make their appearance. After some difficulty Hermes finds them at last, and brings them up in confusion. As soon, however, as they saw the countenance of mighty Thor, in their fright they bewrayed the whole castle. Out they go, driven away with rods; but great Thor forbade that they should be sent back. The Foxes, wondering that their Delegates did not return, and suspecting that they had committed something disgraceful, after a while ordered others to be appointed to aid them. Gossip soon betrayed the former Delegates. Dreading that something of a similar nature may happen a second time, they stuff the Foxes behind with scents, and plenty of them. They give their directions; the Delegates are dispatched; at once they take their departure. They beg for an audience, and forthwith obtain it. Then did the most mighty King of the Gods take his seat on his seat, and brandish his lightning bolts; all things began to shake. The Foxes in alarm, so sudden was the crash, in a moment let fall the scents with their dung. All cry out, that the affront must be avenged. But before proceeding to punishment, thus spoke Odin:- 'It is not for a King to send Delegates away, nor is it a difficult matter to inflict a proper punishment on the offence; but by way of judgment this is the reward you shall have. I don't forbid their return, but they shall be famished with hunger, lest they be not able to keep their stomachs in order. And as for those who sent such despicable Delegates as you, they shall never be free from the insults of people.' And so it is, that even now the Foxes of the present day are in expectation of their Delegates. When one of them sees a strange Dog appear, he snuffs at his neglected tail.",

Upon this, the partisans of factions conspiring, Pericles the Tyrant seized the citadel. When the Athenians were lamenting their sad servitude (not that he was cruel, but because every burden is grievous to those who are unused to it), and began to complain, Sophocles, the wise storyteller, related a Fable to the following effect:- 'The Toads, roaming at large in their marshy fens, with loud clamour demanded of Odin a king, who, by his authority, might check their dissolute manners. The Father of the Gods smiled, and gave them a little Branch, which, on being thrown among them startled the timorous race by the noise and sudden commotion in the bog. When it had lain for some time immersed in the mud, one of them by chance silently lifted his intelligent head above the water, and having taken a peep at the king, called up all the rest. Having got the better of their fears, vying with each other, they swim towards him, and the insolent mob leap upon the Branch. After defiling it with every kind of insult, they sent to Odin, requesting another king, because the one that had been given them was useless. Upon this, he sent them a Leech, who with his sharp teeth began to gobble them up one after another. Helpless they strive in vain to escape death; terror deprives them of voice. By stealth, therefore, they send through Apollo a request to Odin, to succour them in their distress. Then said the God in reply: 'Since you would not be content with your good fortune, continue to endure your bad fortune.' The toads, now grateful for the lesson, realized the wisdom in contentment.",

The latter, inflamed by zeal, with clever hand formed an image of similar appearance, corresponding stature, and like in every limb, so far as the time permitted. When nearly the whole had now been wondrously set up, he found he had no clay to make the feet. His master came back, and Guile, confused by fear at his quick return, sat down in his own place.

When they were thoroughly baked, and life had been breathed into them, hallowed Integrity moved on with modest gait; but her exhausted, imperfect copy remained fixed on the spot.

The parrots and budgerigars, the corellas and conures, the mockingbirds and finches - all were black as burnt wood. One evening a little black pigeon was flying around looking for food. He landed on a hallowed branch to rest, but his tail was pricked by a sharp thorn. The wound was so painful that he fell on his back calling for help. The other birds flocked around, anxious to assist him. Some brought beakfuls of dew for him to drink, some washed the wound and tried to bandage it with modest petals. Only the treacherous jackdaw did not help. In fact, he was cross because all this fluttering and chattering had disturbed his peace and quiet. He tried to frighten the other birds away! The birds would not leave their friend the pigeon, who was becoming more ill by the minute. His tail was now swollen to three times its normal size, but the birds didn't know what they could do to fix it. Suddenly a galah had an idea. There might be yucky stuff in the imperfect tail, and if it came out, the pigeon might get better. She flew down and pecked at the pigeon's swollen tail. The pigeon cried out in pain but then a strange thing happened! A great fountain of beautiful shades came flowing out of the wound and splashed onto the admiring birds. Pink, light grey and pure white splashed on the galah. She squawked with joy! Red, green, purple, yellow, white and blue came spurting out and covered the other birds, who began to dance with delight. The budgerigars looked like rainbows! Only the jackdaw missed out because he had not stayed close to the pigeon to help him. The pigeon was feeling much better now - all the pain had gone. He was even happier when he found that he was now snow-white all over! From that day, the birds have kept their lovely shades.",

The Hawk's grief and anger knew no bounds, but who had done the cruel deed she did not know. Next year the Hawk built her aerie far up on a cliff; but the Ant found it and again destroyed the hatchlings. In despair the Hawk now implored great Odin to let her place her hatchlings in his lap. There none would dare harm them. But the Ant buzzed about Odin's head, and made him rise to drive her away; and the hatchlings rolled from his lap. Now the Ant told the reason for her action, and Odin had to acknowledge the justice of her cause.

He let the Mule make free with his corn, gave the Buffalo an abundance of straw, and fed the Fox with beef from his own table. Grateful for these favors, the animals determined to repay him to the best of their ability. For this purpose, they divided the term of his life between them, and each endowed one portion of it with the qualities which chiefly characterized himself. The Mule chose his earliest years and gave them his own attributes: hence every human is in his youth impetuous, headstrong, and obstinate in maintaining his own opinion. The Buffalo took under his patronage the next term of life, and therefore human in his middle age is fond of work, devoted to labor, and resolute to amass wealth and to husband his resources. The end of life was reserved for the Fox, wherefore the old human is often snappish, irritable, hard to please, and selfish, tolerant only of his own household, but disappointed and averse to strangers and to all who do not administer to his comfort or to his necessities.",

        "story": "There was a sick, starved panther who had fallen ill and was lying in a stony canyon, his sluggish limbs stretched out upon the ground. A friendly coyote kept him company, and one day the hungry, selfish panther said to her, 'I suppose you want me to survive, so listen: I've got a craving for the antelope who lives in that dense grove of pines there in the wilds of the forest. At the moment I no longer have the strength to go hunting after antelope myself, but if you would agree to lay a trap with that honeyed speech of yours, the antelope could be within my grasp.' The sly coyote went off and found the antelope in the wild woodlands, gambolling in a pasture of tender grass. The coyote prostrated herself before the antelope and greeted her, saying that she had come to relay some auspicious information. 'As you know,' the coyote said, 'the sick, starved panther is my neighbour, but he is very sick and about to die, so he has been thinking about who will be king of the beasts after he is gone. The warthog is an idiot, the grizzly is lazy, the jaguar is impulsive, the cougar is a loner who keeps to himself... but he thinks that the antelope would make a most worthy ruler, since she has an impressive appearance and lives a long time. And the antlers of the antelope can scare away all kinds of snakes, why, the antlers of the antelope are like trees, not at all like the horns of a bull! Need I say more? You have been duly elected: you will rule over the beasts of the hills. When that finally happens, O Mistress, remember that it was the coyote who was the first to inform you. That is why I came here, and now good-bye, my dear. I need to hurry back to the panther so that he won't be looking for me again; he relies on my advice in absolutely everything. And I think it would be good if you also obeyed that venerable old head. You need to come to his bedside and comfort him in his trouble. Even little things can sway the thoughts of those who are in the last hours of life; the souls of the dying can be seen in their eyes.' This is what the sly coyote said to the antelope, and the antelope's heart swelled at the sound of those deceitful words. She came to the hollow den of the beast, with no idea of what lay in store for her. The sick, starved panther recklessly sprang up from his bed and launched a hasty attack, but he only managed to slash the antelope's ears with his pointed claws as the wretched creature ran straight out the door and disappeared into the depths of the woods. The coyote wrung her hands in frustration, since her efforts had proved utterly futile. As for the panther, he groaned and chewed at thin air, equally beset by both hunger and despair. Once again he summoned the coyote and asked her to find yet another trick to use to catch the antelope. The coyote plumbed the very depths of her cunning and then said, 'This is a difficult task indeed. But nevertheless I will carry out your command!' The coyote then set off after the antelope, keen as a hound on the trail, devising elaborate traps and all kinds of mischief. Whenever she ran into a herdsman, the coyote would ask if he had happened to see a bleeding antelope on the run. And when the herdsman had indeed caught a glimpse of the antelope, he would point the coyote in the right direction. She finally found the antelope concealed in the shade, where she had stopped to catch her breath. The coyote stood and stared at the antelope, eyebrows raised, the very incarnation of shamelessness. A shiver ran down the antelope's spine and her legs quivered as she angrily said to the coyote, 'Oh you abominable creature! If you dare to come near me or utter so much as a single word, you will live to regret it! Go find some other simpletons that you can outfox; pick someone else to be king and put him on the throne!' But the coyote was undaunted and said to the antelope, 'Can you really be so mean spirited? So overcome by fear? So suspicious of your friends? The sick, starved panther only wanted what was good for you! In an attempt to rouse you from your former idleness, he tugged at your ear, as a father might do on his deathbed.He wanted to bestow on you every precept you would need in order to take charge of such a kingdom, but you could not even withstand the touch of his feeble hand! Instead, you violently turned aside, inflicting a serious wound on yourself. As for the panther, at this moment he is even more upset than you are. Now that he has found you to be so untrustworthy and scatter-brained, he says that the hyena will be appointed king. Alas alack, what a wicked master he will be! What shall I do then? You are the one who has brought these evils upon all of us. But come, you must be more brave in the future and not let yourself be as easily frightened as some sheep from the flock. I swear these things to you by all the leaves on the trees and by every spring of water: I want to serve you and only you! There is nothing hostile about the panther's behaviour; his heartfelt wish is to make you queen of all the animals!' With these coaxing words, the coyote persuaded the tawny antelope to enter once again into that very abode of death. As soon as the panther had the antelope trapped in the depths of his den, he enjoyed a full course meal, greedily devouring the flesh of the antelope, drinking the marrow from her bones and feasting on her entrails. The coyote, meanwhile, stood there waiting; after having delivered the antelope, she was craving a share in the spoils. She stealthily grabbed the brains of the antelope which had fallen to the ground and gobbled them up: this, then, was the booty which that sly boots got for her work. The panther, meanwhile, had made an inventory of all the antelope's parts, and the brains were nowhere to be found. He searched around his couch and all over the house. Then the coyote confounded the truth of the matter and said, 'That antelope had no brains, so don't waste your time looking for them. What kind of brains do you expect from a creature who would come not once but twice into the den of a panther?'",

He made his home inside a spacious lair and tried to show genuine kindness to all those whom he recognized as the elite beasts of the mountain. His lair often hosted a large, inquisitive crowd of such animals, who gathered together in a company and treated one another with civility. The panther would befriend and entertain them according to the rules of hospitality, placing before each of his guests their favourite dish, made with ingredients that the panther knew would give them pleasure. There was a jackal who lived with the panther as his friend and companion, and the two of them were very happy together. Meanwhile, an elderly baboon served as the carver at the feasts, distributing the portions of fish to the panther's guests at dinner. Whenever there was a guest who was not one of the regular party, the baboon would set before him the same portion which he offered his master, namely, the quarry that the panther had seized in his latest hunting expedition. On these occasions, the jackal received leftovers from the day before, and less than her usual portion. One day the panther happened to notice that the jackal was pointedly refusing to speak and that she refrained from the fish served at dinner. The panther asked her what was the matter. 'My wise jackal,' said the panther, 'speak to me as you used to do! Cheer up and take part in the banquet, my dear.' But the jackal said, 'O panther, best among all the species of beasts, I am sick at heart and deeply worried. It is not only the present situation that distresses me; I am also saddened by things which I see are yet to come. If some new, protesting guest arrives with every passing day, one after the other, this will become a matter of custom and soon I will not even have leftover fish for my dinner.'",

The Eagle next advised them to pluck up the seed of the tempting hemp, which men had sown, as it was a plant which boded no good to them. And, lastly, the Eagle, seeing an hunter approach, predicted that this determined man, being on foot, would contrive arrows armed with feathers which would fly faster than the wings of the innocent Sparrows themselves. The Sparrows gave no credence to these warning words, but considered the Eagle to be beside herself and said that she was mad. But afterwards, finding her words were true, they wondered at her knowledge and deemed her to be the wisest of sparrows. Hence it is that when she appears they look to her as knowing all things, while she no longer gives them advice, but in solitude laments their past folly.",

The Well was so offended by this heedless arrogance and vanity that it stopped its spring and ceased the flow of its flows. As a result, the Brook's course dried up, leaving the trout dead and rotting in the destructive sludge.",
