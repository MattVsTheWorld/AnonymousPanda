Some months elapsed before he found Himself recover'd of his wound: Meantime, according to their way, The droll frequenters of the play Had a great miss of him, whose touch The dancers' spirits raised so much. A certain man of high renown Was just preparing for the town Some games the mob to entertain, When Prince began to walk again; Whom, what with bribes and pray'rs, his grace Prevail'd upon to show his face In this performance, by all means- And while he waits behind the scenes, A rumour through the house is spread, By certain, that 'the piper's dead.' Others cried out, 'The man is here, And will immediately appear.' The curtain draws, the lightnings flash, The gods speak out their usual trash. An ode, not to the Piper known, Was to the chorus leader shown, Which he was order'd to repeat, And which was closed with this conceit- 'Receive with joy, O loyal Rome, Thy Prince just rescued from his tomb.' They all at once stand up and clap, At which my most facetious chap Kisses his hand, and scrapes and bows To his good patrons in the house. First the equestrian order smoke The fool's mistake, and high in joke, Command the song to be encored; Which ended, flat upon the board The Piper falls, the knights acclaim; The people think that Prince's aim Is for a crown of bays at least. Now all the seats perceived the jest, And with his bandage white as snow, White frock, white pumps, a perfect beauty Proud of the feats he had achieved, And these high honours he received, With one unanimous huzza, Poor Prince was kick'd out of the play."

Thus having filled the Eagle's pate With consternation very great, Down creeps she to the Sow below; 'The Eagle is your deadly foe, And is determined not to spare Your pigs, when you shall take the air.' Here too a terror being spread, By what this tattling gossip said, She slily to her kittens stole, And rested snug within her hole. Sneaking from thence with silent tread By night her family she fed, But look'd out sharply all the day, Affecting terror and dismay. The Eagle lest the tree should fall, Keeps to the boughs, nor stirs at all; And anxious for her grunting race, The Sow is loth to quit her place. In short, they and their young ones starve, And leave a prey for Puss to carve."

A certain noble, on a day, Having a mind to show away, Invited by reward the mimes And play'rs and tumblers of the times, And built a large commodious stage For the choice spirits of the age: But, above all, amongst the rest There came a genius who profess'd To have a curious trick in store That never was perform'd before. Through all the town this soon got air, And the whole house was like a fair; But soon his entry as he made, Without a prompter or parade, 'Twas all expectance and suspense, And silence gagg'd the audience. He, stooping down and looking big, So wondrous well took off a pig, All swore 'twas serious, and no joke, For that, or underneath his cloak He had concealed some grunting elf, Or was a real hog himself. A search was made-no pig was found- With thund'ring claps the seats resound, And pit, and box, and gall'ries roar With- 'O rare! bravo!' and 'encore.' Old Roger Grouse, a country clown, Who yet knew something of the town, Beheld the mimic of his whim, And on the morrow challenged him Declaring to each beau and belle That he this grunter would excel. The morrow came-the crowd was greater- But prejudice and rank ill-nature Usurp'd the minds of men and wenches, Who came to hiss and break the benches. The mimic took his usual station, And squeak'd with general approbation; Again 'Encore! encore!' they cry- ''Tis quite the thing, 'tis very high.' Old Grouse conceal'd, amidst this racket, A real pig beneath his jacket- Then forth he came, and with his nail He pinch'd the urchin by the tail. The tortured pig, from out his throat, Produced the genuine nat'ral note. All bellow'd out 'twas very sad! Sure never stuff was half so bad. 'That like a pig!' each cried in scoff; 'Pshaw! nonsense! blockhead! off! off! off!' The mimic was extoll'd, and Grouse Was hiss'd, and catcall'd from the house. 'Soft ye, a word before I go,' Quoth honest Hodge; and stooping low, Produced the pig, and thus aloud Bespoke the stupid partial crowd: 'Behold, and learn from this poor cratur, How much you critics know of natur!' As yet my muse is not to seek, But can from fresh materials speak; And our poetic fountain springs With rich variety of things. But you're for sallies short and sweet; Long tales their purposes defeat. Wherefore, thou worthiest, best of men Particulo, for whom my pen Immortal honour will insure, Long as a rev'rence shall endure For Roman learning-if this strain Cannot your approbation gain, Yet, yet my brevity admire, Which may the more to praise aspire, The more our poets now-a-days Are tedious in their lifeless lays."

''Tis not my profit here to stay,' He cries; 'but I must Jove obey.' 'What! will you therefore nothing take Yourself, nor others welcome make?' 'Ev'n so the fates decree:' -'Then, sir, Have patience, whilst I do aver That he who like affections knows Is born with all the gods his foes. Since to that place you needs must speed, Where all your ancestors precede, Why in the blindness of your heart Do you torment your noble part?' All this to thee do I indite, Thou grudging churl, thy heir's delight, Who robb'st the gods of incense due, Thyself of food and raiment too; Who hear'st the harp with sullen mien, To whom the piper gives the spleen; Who'rt full of heavy groans and sighs When in their price provisions rise; Who with thy frauds heaven's patience tire To make thy heap a little higher, And, lest death thank thee, in thy will Hast tax'd the undertaker's bill."

'Wretch that thou art!' a bullock cried, 'That com'st within this place to hide; By trusting man you are undone, And into sure destruction run.' But he with suppliant voice replies: 'Do you but wink with both your eyes, I soon shall my occasions shape, To make from hence a fair escape.' The day is spent, the night succeeds, The herdsman comes, the cattle feeds, But nothing sees-then to and fro Time after time the servants go; Yet not a soul perceives the case. The steward passes by the place, Himself no wiser than the rest. The joyful Stag his thanks address'd To all the Oxen, that he there Had found a refuge in despair. 'We wish you well,' an Ox return'd, 'But for your life are still concern'd, For if old Argus come, no doubt, His hundred eyes will find you out.' Scarce had the speaker made an end, When from the supper of a friend The master enters at the door, And, seeing that the steers were poor Of late, advances to the rack. 'Why were the fellow's hands so slack? Here's hardly any straw at all, Brush down those cobwebs from the wall. Pray how much labour would it ask?' While thus he undertakes the task, To dust, and rummage by degrees, The Stag's exalted horns he sees: Then calling all his folks around, He lays him breathless on the ground."

But, for the future, lest this blaze, At which the pious pray and praise, Should guide the wicked, I decree That no such intercourse there be.' Hence to this day all men decline To light their candle at the shrine; Nor from a candle e'er presume The holy light to re-illume.

At which the man of spirit drew, And instantly disarm'd and slew The Thief, his honor to maintain. Soon as the rogue was fairly slain, The tim'rous chap began to puff, And drew his sword, and stripp'd in buff- 'Leave me alone with him! stand back! I'll teach him whom he should attack.' Then he who fought, 'I wish, my friend, But now you'd had such words to lend; I might have been confirm'd the more, Supposing truth to all you swore; Then put your weapon in the sheath, And keep your tongue within your teeth, Though you may play an actor's part On them who do not know your heart.

At evening tide they let me out, And then I freely walk about: Bread comes without a care of mine.

Hence, as a factious discontent Through every rank and order went, Pisistratus the tyrant form'd A party, and the fort he storm'd: Which yoke, while all bemoan'd in grief, (Not that he was a cruel chief, But they unused to be controll'd) Then Esop thus his fable told: The Frogs, a freeborn people made, From out their marsh with clamor pray'd That Jove a monarch would assign With power their manners to refine. The sovereign smiled, and on their bog Sent his petitioners a log, Which, as it dash'd upon the place, At first alarm'd the tim'rous race. But ere it long had lain to cool, One slily peep'd out of the pool, And finding it a king in jest, He boldly summon'd all the rest. Now, void of fear, the tribe advanced, And on the timber leap'd and danced, And having let their fury loose, In gross affronts and rank abuse, Of Jove they sought another king, For useless was this wooden thing. Then he a water-snake empower'd, Who one by one their race devour'd. They try to make escape in vain, Nor, dumb through fear, can they complain. By stealth they Mercury depute, That Jove would once more hear their suit, And send their sinking state to save; But he in wrath this answer gave: 'You scorn'd the good king that you had, And therefore you shall bear the bad.' Ye likewise, O Athenian friends, Convinced to what impatience tends, Though slavery be no common curse, Be still, for fear of worse and worse."
