The bird-trap was quite empty, as he had caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which he had tamed for a decoy. The bird entreated earnestly for his life: What would you do without me when next you spread your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for you the covey of answering birds?' The Birdcatcher spared his life, and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to his comb. But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his perch: If you kill me, who will announce to you the appearance of the dawn? Who will wake you to your daily tasks or tell you when it is time to visit the bird-trap in the morning?' He replied, What you say is true. You are a capital bird at telling the time of day. But my friend and I must have our dinners."

The soup fell out of the long bill of the Crane at every mouthful, and his vexation at not being able to eat afforded the Fox much amusement. The Crane, in his turn, asked the Fox to sup with him, and set before her a flagon with a long narrow mouth, so that he could easily insert his neck and enjoy its contents at his leisure. The Fox, unable even to taste it, met with a fitting requital, after the fashion of her own hospitality."

The goat, however, feared that his back might do her some harm if he took her upon it. The ram, he felt sure, was the proper friend to apply to. So she went to the ram and told him the case. The ram replied: Another time, my dear friend. I do not like to interfere on the present occasion, as hounds have been known to eat sheep as well as hares. The Hare then applied, as a last hope, to the calf, who regretted that he was unable to help her, as he did not like to take the responsibility upon himself, as so many older persons than himself had declined the task. By this time the hounds were quite near, and the Hare took to her heels and luckily escaped."

Having secured a large booty, the Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Ass carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass. Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division. The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said, Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division? You are perfect to a fraction. He replied, I learned it from the Ass, by witnessing his fate."

So, alighting with his son, they tied the legs of the Ass together and with the help of a pole endeavored to carry him on their shoulders over a bridge near the entrance to the town. This entertaining sight brought the people in crowds to laugh at it, till the Ass, not liking the noise nor the strange handling that he was subject to, broke the cords that bound him and, tumbling off the pole, fell into the river. Upon this, the old man, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that by endeavoring to please everybody he had pleased nobody, and lost his Ass in the bargain."

They felt sure that something horrible was going to happen. They all gathered together in one place to see what terrible thing this could be. They waited and they waited, but nothing came. At last there was a still more violent earthquake, and a huge gap appeared in the side of the Mountains. They all fell down upon their knees and waited. At last, and at last, a teeny, tiny mouse poked its little head and bristles out of the gap and came running down towards them."

When he came closer he saw it was a Serpent to all appearance dead. But he took it up and put it in his bosom to warm while he hurried home. As soon as he got indoors he put the Serpent down on the hearth before the fire. The children watched it and saw it slowly come to life again. Then one of them stooped down to stroke it, but the Serpent raised its head and put out its fangs and was about to sting the child to death. So the Woodman seized his axe, and with one stroke cut the Serpent in two."

        "original": "Story: There is a little bird who is called the crested lark. She lives in the wheat fields and makes her nest there precisely at the time of year that will allow her chicks to just be getting their feathers when the harvest is gathered. One time, the lark happened to have made her nest in some crops that had ripened earlier than usual and as a result her chicks were still not able to fly when the wheat had already turned to yellow. So when the mother bird went to gather food for her chicks, she warned them that if anything unexpected should happen or if the chicks should chance to hear anything, they should pay close attention and tell her everything as soon as she returned. Meanwhile, the farmer whose field it was called his young son and said, 'Do you see how the crops have ripened and now require our labour? As soon as it is light tomorrow, go to our friends and ask them to come lend a hand to help harvest our crop.' Having said this to his son, the farmer then went away. When the lark came back home, the terrified chicks all began chirping in fright and begged their mother to hurry up and take them right away to some other nesting place, since the farmer had sent someone to ask his friends to come at dawn and reap the harvest. The mother ordered them to stay calm. 'If the farmer is expecting his friends to help with the harvest,' she said, 'there will be no harvesting of the crops tomorrow, and there is no need for me to carry you away today.' The next day the mother flew away again to look for food. The farmer, meanwhile, was waiting for the friends that he had summoned. The sun was blazing high in the sky but nothing was happening; the day dragged on, but none of the farmer's friends appeared. The farmer again spoke to his son and said, 'Our friends are all so lazy! Why don't we go ask our relatives to come right away and help with the harvesting tomorrow?' As on the day before, the chicks were stricken with terror and told their mother what had happened. The mother urged them once again to not be afraid or worry: relatives never obey such requests for help right away, since they are hardly willing to get to work so quickly. 'But pay attention,' she said, 'in case you hear something different tomorrow.' The next day at dawn the mother bird went off in search of food, while the farmer's relatives failed to supply the help that had been requested of them. So the farmer finally said to his son, 'Enough of these friends and relatives! At first light tomorrow I want you to bring two sickles, one for me and one for you: we will reap the wheat tomorrow by ourselves, using our own hands.' When the mother learned from her chicks what the farmer had said, she concluded, 'Now it is time for us to surrender our home and move away: without a doubt, it will happen just as the farmer said. It's up to him now that he's not expecting anybody else to help.' So the lark abandoned her nest and the farmer harvested his crops.",

        "original": "Story: In exchange for an agreed upon fee, the poet Simonides was to write a victory ode for a certain boxer. Simonides accordingly sought out a place of peace and quiet, but the unpromising subject matter hampered his artistic impulse. As a result, Simonides relied on the usual poetic license, which allowed him to include the gods Castor and Pollux as part of his poem, alluding to the renown that the sons of Leda, those celestial twins, had also enjoyed in boxing. Simonides' client praised the work but he paid the poet only one third of the agreed upon fee. When Simonides demanded the rest, his patron told him, 'Let the twins pay the rest, since their praise occupies two thirds of the poem! Of course,' the man added, 'I don't want people to think that you have been sent away in anger, so please agree to come to my house for dinner this evening. I have invited all my relatives, and I want you to be in their number as well.' Although Simonides had been cheated and was still upset about the loss he had suffered, he agreed to come, not wanting to harm his reputation by parting with his patron on bad terms. The dinner hour arrived and Simonides took his place at the table. The party sparkled with wine and good cheer, and the house resounded with the delightful sounds of the extravagant banquet, when all of a sudden two young men appeared. They were completely covered with dust and sweat, and they had the bodies of supermen. They ordered one of the servant boys to summon Simonides, urging him to be quick about it, as it was a matter of great importance. The awestruck servant roused Simonides, and the poet had barely moved one foot away from the dining room when the structure suddenly collapsed, crushing everyone beneath it. Meanwhile, there were no young men to be found at the door. When the sequence of events became generally known, everyone realized that with their presence, the gods had repaid the poet by saving his life in lieu of a fee.",

The bat begged for mercy but the weasel refused, since weasels are the natural enemies of every kind of bird. The bat insisted that she was not a bird at all, but only a mouse, so the weasel let her go. Later on, the bat fell to the ground again and was seized by another weasel. The bat also begged this weasel not to kill her, but the weasel refused, since there was a war between the mice and the weasels. The bat denied that she was a mouse, but only a bat, so once again the weasel let her go. As a result, the bat was able to save herself twice by changing her name."

Zeus was at a loss when faced with his request, since he felt affection for the human race. He therefore told the bee, 'I cannot do exactly that: but if some man does come to take your honey and you want to get rid of him, here is your sting! Yet you must keep in mind that if you strike a man, you will die at the moment your sting has gone in.'"

        "original": "Story: There was a flute player named Prince who was more or less well-known, since he provided the musical accompaniment for Bathyllus the dancer. At one of their shows, I don't remember precisely which one, the stage machinery unexpectedly swung around and Prince tumbled down onto the stage. He broke his left leg and fell flat on his face (he must have been playing in the key of B-flat). They picked him up and carted him off the stage as he moaned and groaned. It took him several months to recover. Given that theatre-goers are such a sentimental and devoted lot, they began to miss him; after all, his flute playing had always roused the dancers to greater heights. A prominent citizen was about to stage a public performance and now that Prince was again able to walk using a cane, the man persuaded him with invitations (and a fee) to at least put in an appearance on the day of the show. As soon as Prince arrived, rumours of the flute player's return buzzed throughout the theatre: while some swore he was dead, others claimed that he was about to show himself to the entire audience in just a moment. Then the curtains parted and there was a thunderous clang announcing the arrival of the gods who made their usual speech, and then the chorus started in with a song that Prince did not recognize, since he had been away from the theatre for several months. The song's refrain went like this: 'Rejoice, O Rome: you are safe now that the prince is well!' The audience stood up to applaud. The flute player blew kisses to them, thinking that his fans were congratulating him on his recovery. The people in the front row seats realized the man's foolish mistake and with a roar of laughter they demanded an encore. The song was repeated, and our hero prostrated himself at full-length on the stage. The front rows continued their mock applause, while the crowd thought Prince was simply bowing in honour of the chorus. Eventually, however, the entire audience realized his mistake and at that point the 'Prince,' dressed in a white gown, his leg wrapped in a white bandage -- he even had white shoes on his feet! -- was tossed headfirst off the stage.

While the two of them were playing childish games, they happened to look into a mirror which had been left lying on their mother's armchair. The boy boasted about his beauty, and this made the girl angry. She couldn't stand her boastful brother's jokes, since she naturally took everything he said as a slight against herself. Spurred by jealousy, the girl wanted to get back at her brother, so she went running to their father and accused her brother of having touched something that was only for women, even though he was a man. The father hugged and kissed his children, bestowing his tender affection on them both, and said, 'I want for you to use the mirror each and every day: you, my son, so that you will remember not to spoil your good looks by behaving badly, and you, my daughter, so that you will remember to compensate for your appearance by the good quality of your character.'"

The mouse said, 'Whatever you want!' The cat said, 'If I set you free this time, will you come when I call you?' The mouse replied, 'You have my solemn promise.' The cat said, 'Swear an oath!' So the mouse swore an oath. The cat then rescued the mouse and let him go. Then one day the cat was hungry. He went to the mouse's hole and told him to come out. The mouse said, 'I refuse.' The cat said, 'Didn't you swear to me that you would come when I called you?' The mouse said, 'Brother, I was drunk when I swore that oath!'"

The eagle then soared on his outspread wings and seized a hare, which he promptly brought back as a gift for the man who had rescued him. A fox saw what the eagle was doing and shouted, 'He's not the one who needs your attention! You should give the hare to the first man, so that if he ever catches you again, he won't deprive you of your wing feathers like the first time.'"

The city mouse finished his business in the country and by means of insistent invitations he persuaded the country mouse to come pay him a visit. The city mouse then brought the country mouse into a room that was overflowing with food. As they were feasting on various delicacies, a butler opened the door. The city mouse quickly concealed himself in a familiar mouse hole, but the poor country mouse was not acquainted with the house and frantically scurried around the floorboards, frightened out of his wits. When the butler had taken what he needed, he closed the door behind him. The city mouse then urged the country mouse to sit back down to dinner. The country mouse refused and said, 'How could I possibly do that? Oh, how scared I am! Do you think that the man is going to come back?' This was all that the terrified mouse was able to say. The city mouse insisted, 'My dear fellow, you could never find such delicious food as this anywhere else in the world.'

A crow then arrived on the scene and as she winged her way past the eagle she said, 'Well now, you have grasped an excellent prize in your talons, but unless I show you what to do with it, its weight will exhaust you to no avail.' When the eagle promised to share with the crow, the crow advised her to drop the hard shell from the starry heights down onto the rocks. After the shell had been shattered, the tortoise's meat would be easily consumed. The eagle was persuaded by the crow's clever counsel and carried out the plan, generously sharing the feast with her teacher. Thus even something protected by a gift of nature was no match for these two, and the tortoise died a pitiful death."

Finally the driver took the entire load and shifted it from the donkey to the mule. At that point the mule glanced over at the donkey and said, 'What do you say now: don't I deserve a double portion of food?'"

One of the oxen said to the fugitive, 'You wretched creature, what on earth are you trying to do? You have sealed your own death warrant by trusting your life to the protection of a human house!' But the stag implored the oxen, 'Have mercy, I beg you! At the first opportunity, I'll run back out again.' The passing hours of the day gave way to night. A cowherd brought some leafy boughs into the stall but saw nothing amiss. The various farm workers came and went, but no one noticed a thing; the bailiff also passed through but even he didn't observe anything out of the ordinary. The stag was delighted and began thanking the oxen who had kept quiet on his behalf and had extended such welcome hospitality in a moment of need. One of the oxen said to the stag, 'We do indeed wish you all the best, but if the man of a hundred eyes should come, your life will hang in the balance.' Meanwhile, after dinner, the master himself came to inspect the manger since he had noticed that the oxen had been looking rather sickly. 'Why is there so little fodder here?' he shouted. 'And look, not enough bedding! And how much trouble would it be to get rid of these spider webs?' As the master examined each and every thing, he also noticed the stag's tall horns. He called his servants and ordered them to kill the stag and to carry his carcass away.",

Hoping to escape certain death at their hands, he ran blindly in terror towards the nearest farmhouse and concealed himself in a convenient stall where the oxen were kept. One of the oxen said to the fugitive, 'You wretched creature, what on earth are you trying to do? You have sealed your own death warrant by trusting your life to the protection of a human house!' But the stag implored the oxen, 'Have mercy, I beg you! At the first opportunity, I'll run back out again.' The passing hours of the day gave way to night. A cowherd brought some leafy boughs into the stall but saw nothing amiss. The various farm workers came and went, but no one noticed a thing; the bailiff also passed through but even he didn't observe anything out of the ordinary. The stag was delighted and began thanking the oxen who had kept quiet on his behalf and had extended such welcome hospitality in a moment of need. One of the oxen said to the stag, 'We do indeed wish you all the best, but if the man of a hundred eyes should come, your life will hang in the balance.' Meanwhile, after dinner, the master himself came to inspect the manger since he had noticed that the oxen had been looking rather sickly. 'Why is there so little fodder here?' he shouted. 'And look, not enough bedding! And how much trouble would it be to get rid of these spider webs?' As the master examined each and every thing, he also noticed the stag's tall horns. He called his servants and ordered them to kill the stag and to carry his carcass away."

The boy died on the spot. The boy's parents were filled with immense sorrow and the grief-stricken father seized his axe and tried to kill the malevolent snake. When the snake fled his pursuer, the man hurried after him, raising his weapon, determined to strike, but as the farmer was about to deal the snake a deadly blow, he missed and managed only to cut off the tip of his tail. The man was terrified at the thought that he might have killed the snake, so he took cakes and water along with honey and salt and called to the snake, wanting to make peace with him. The snake, however, only hissed softly at the farmer from where he had hidden himself in the rocks and said: 'Man, do not trouble yourself any longer: there can be no possible friendship between us any more. When I look upon my tail, I am in pain. The same is true for you: whenever you look again upon the grave of your son, you will not be able to live in peace with me.'"

The wolf seized this opportunity to denounce the fox in front of the lion, complaining that the fox showed no respect for the lion, who was the common master of them all. Indeed, the fox had not even come to pay the ailing lion a visit! The fox arrived just in time to hear the end of the wolf's speech. The lion roared at the fox, but the fox asked for a chance to explain herself. 'After all,' said the fox, 'which one of all the animals assembled here has helped you as I have, travelling all over the world in order to seek out and discover from the doctors a remedy for your illness?' The lion ordered the fox to describe the remedy immediately, and the fox replied, 'You must flay a living wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm.' When the wolf had been killed, the fox laughed and said, 'It is better to put your master in a good mood, not a bad one.'"

They say that she makes her nest on the rocky cliffs of the coast in order to protect herself from human hunters. So when a certain halcyon was about to lay her eggs, she went to a promontory and found a rock jutting out towards the sea and decided to make her nest there. But when she went to look for food, it happened that the sea swelled under the blustering wind and reached as high as the halcyon's home and flooded the nest, killing her chicks. When the halcyon returned and saw what had happened, she said, 'What a fool I was to have protected myself against a plot hatched on the land by taking refuge here on the sea, when it is the sea that has utterly betrayed me!'"

The Hawk, interrupting him, said: 'I should indeed have lost my senses if I should let go food ready in my hand, for the sake of pursuing birds which are not yet even within sight.'"

When she saw the boy, who looked very beautiful in the shining moonlight, she left her husband asleep and went downstairs and out the door. She then met the boy in the street and satisfied herself completely. All of a sudden her husband woke up and wanted to find out where his wife had gone. Not finding her inside the house, he didn't just stand there gaping but instead followed her outside and said, 'It's alright. Go ahead and persuade the boy to sleep in our house.' So he took the boy and brought him inside. He didn't have any trouble after that, and joined in whenever the two of them wanted to do something."

One of the mice thought that she must be something good to eat, but as soon as he pounced, the weasel caught him and consigned him to oblivion; another mouse did the same, and a third mouse likewise met his doom. A few mice later, another mouse arrived: his skin was wrinkled with extreme old age and he had escaped many a time from snares and traps. Already at a distance he recognized the ambush prepared by their cunning enemy. 'You there, lying in the corner,' said the mouse, 'I wish you well if -- and only if -- you really are made of flour!'"

While the guard was spending his nights in the widow's embrace, one of the corpses was spirited away from the cross. The soldier was upset and told the woman what had happened. That exemplary woman said, 'Don't worry!' and with these words, she handed over her husband's corpse to be nailed to the cross, so that the soldier would not be punished for dereliction of duty.",

The goat climbed up on a tall cliff where he was safe, so the wolf besieged the goat from the bottom of the cliff. After two or three days, when the wolf had grown hungry and the goat had grown thirsty, they each went away: the wolf left first in order to look for food and then the goat went away to find a drink of water. When he had quenched his thirst, the goat noticed his reflection in the water and said, 'Oh what fine legs I have and what a beautiful beard and what great horns! Just let that wolf try to make me run away: this time I will defend myself! I will not let that wolf have any power over me!' Behind the goat's back, the wolf had been listening in silence to every word the goat said. Then, as he plunged his teeth deep into the goat's flank, the wolf asked, 'What is this you are saying, brother goat?' The goat, when he realized he was trapped, said, 'O my lord wolf, I admit my mistake and beg your forgiveness! After a goat has something to drink, he says things he shouldn't.' But the wolf showed no mercy and devoured the goat."

'Father Aesop -- a name you well deserve since you are like a father to me -- I'm going to be perfectly frank, since you can be safely trusted with my troubles. There's plenty of whipping and not enough food. I'm constantly sent on errands out to the farm without any provisions for the journey. If the master dines at home, I have to wait on him all night long; if he is invited somewhere else, I have to lie outside in the gutter until dawn. I should have earned my freedom by now, but my hairs have gone gray and I'm still slaving away. If I had done anything to deserve this, I would stop complaining and suffer my fate in silence. But the fact is that I never get enough to eat and my cruel master is always after me. For these reasons, along with others that it would take too long to tell you, I've decided to go wherever my feet will lead me.' 'Well,' said Aesop, 'listen to what I say: if you must endure such hardship without having done anything wrong, as you say, then what is going to happen to you now that you really are guilty of something?' With these words of advice, Aesop scared the slave into giving up his plans of escape."

Pompey, being an unsuspecting sort of person, simply could not believe that this soldier would have had the courage to commit such a crime, and he ordered him to be taken away as a disgrace to the regiment. A short time later, an enemy soldier challenged one of our Roman soldiers to a fight, absolutely confident that he would win. All the Roman soldiers feared for their lives, and the chief officers were muttering about what to do. Then the soldier who looked like a fairy but who had the strength of Mars himself, approached one of the officers seated on the raised platform and said in his quavering voice, 'May I?' Pompey was outraged at this appalling state of affairs and ordered the man to be thrown out, but one of Pompey's old friends spoke to him and said, 'I for one think it is better to put this man to the test, since he is entirely dispensable. That would be better than risking a powerful warrior, whose unfortunate loss would be used as proof of your recklessness.' Pompey agreed and allowed the soldier to accept the challenge. As the army watched in amazement, he cut his opponent's head off faster than you can say 'thwack.' Pompey then said to him, 'Soldier, I gladly award you the victor's crown, since you have avenged the honour of the Roman forces -- but may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets (and Pompey also repeated the filthy gesture which the soldier had used when he had sworn his oath) if you are not the man who stole my baggage cart the other night!'",

Then the soldier who looked like a fairy but who had the strength of Mars himself, approached one of the officers seated on the raised platform and said in his quavering voice, 'May I?' Pompey was outraged at this appalling state of affairs and ordered the man to be thrown out, but one of Pompey's old friends spoke to him and said, 'I for one think it is better to put this man to the test, since he is entirely dispensable. That would be better than risking a powerful warrior, whose unfortunate loss would be used as proof of your recklessness.' Pompey agreed and allowed the soldier to accept the challenge. As the army watched in amazement, he cut his opponent's head off faster than you can say 'thwack.' Pompey then said to him, 'Soldier, I gladly award you the victor's crown, since you have avenged the honour of the Roman forces -- but may my eyeballs dribble out of their sockets (and Pompey also repeated the filthy gesture which the soldier had used when he had sworn his oath) if you are not the man who stole my baggage cart the other night!'"

        "original": "Story: There was a certain married man who loved his wife very much and whose son was almost old enough to assume the white toga of manhood. However, one of the man's freedmen was hoping to be appointed as the man's immediate heir, so he called the man aside and lied at great length about the man's son and even more about the bad behaviour of his faithful wife. Finally, he added something that he realized would cause the greatest possible pain to a loving husband: the man's wife was being visited, said the freedman, by an adulterer, thus defiling the reputation of the house with acts of moral turpitude. The man was outraged at the thought of his wife's supposed crimes, so he pretended to make a trip to the countryside, while secretly hiding in town. Then all of a sudden he came home in the night and headed straight for his wife's bedroom. His wife, meanwhile, had ordered their son to sleep in her bed so that she could keep a close eye on him now that he had grown older. While the servants ran here and there looking for a light, the man was no longer able to hold back his explosive outburst of anger. He approached the bed and felt a head there in the dark. When he detected a man's haircut, he plunged his sword through the man's chest, thinking of nothing but avenging his grief. When the lantern was brought, he saw both his son and his noble wife sleeping there next to him. Deep in sleep, his wife was not even aware of what had happened. The man then punished himself in full for the crime he had committed by falling upon the sword he had drawn in his own readiness to believe the worst. Informers pressed charges against the woman and she was taken away to Rome to be tried in court. Although guilty of no crime, she was plagued by jealous suspicions about her taking possession of the family's property. Her advocates stood by her, stoutly defending the claims of this innocent woman. The judges then asked the divine Augustus to help them faithfully carry out their sworn duty, since the complexity of the crime had them baffled. Augustus first dispelled the darkness of the unfair charges laid against the woman and then revealed the true explanation of what had happened, as he pronounced the following sentence: 'Let the freedman who was the cause of this wickedness be punished! Meanwhile, I decree that the woman who has both lost her son and been deprived of her husband should receive our pity rather than our condemnation.

However, one of the man's freedmen was hoping to be appointed as the man's immediate heir, so he called the man aside and lied at great length about the man's son and even more about the bad behaviour of his faithful wife. Finally, he added something that he realized would cause the greatest possible pain to a loving husband: the man's wife was being visited, said the freedman, by an adulterer, thus defiling the reputation of the house with acts of moral turpitude. The man was outraged at the thought of his wife's supposed crimes, so he pretended to make a trip to the countryside, while secretly hiding in town. Then all of a sudden he came home in the night and headed straight for his wife's bedroom. His wife, meanwhile, had ordered their son to sleep in her bed so that she could keep a close eye on him now that he had grown older. While the servants ran here and there looking for a light, the man was no longer able to hold back his explosive outburst of anger. He approached the bed and felt a head there in the dark. When he detected a man's haircut, he plunged his sword through the man's chest, thinking of nothing but avenging his grief. When the lantern was brought, he saw both his son and his noble wife sleeping there next to him. Deep in sleep, his wife was not even aware of what had happened. The man then punished himself in full for the crime he had committed by falling upon the sword he had drawn in his own readiness to believe the worst. Informers pressed charges against the woman and she was taken away to Rome to be tried in court. Although guilty of no crime, she was plagued by jealous suspicions about her taking possession of the family's property. Her advocates stood by her, stoutly defending the claims of this innocent woman. The judges then asked the divine Augustus to help them faithfully carry out their sworn duty, since the complexity of the crime had them baffled. Augustus first dispelled the darkness of the unfair charges laid against the woman and then revealed the true explanation of what had happened, as he pronounced the following sentence: 'Let the freedman who was the cause of this wickedness be punished! Meanwhile, I decree that the woman who has both lost her son and been deprived of her husband should receive our pity rather than our condemnation. If the father had fully investigated the alleged crimes and carefully sifted through the lies, he would not have brought utter ruin upon his house with this appalling crime.'"

Gossip filled the city of Athens, and the mother diligently consulted expert lawyers but none could explain to her how the daughters could not possess what was given to them or how they might not enjoy its benefits; likewise they could not say how girls who had nothing would be able to pay such a sum of money to their mother. A great deal of time had been lost in delaying, and still the meaning of the will could not be grasped, so the mother put the law aside and appealed to common sense. To the lascivious daughter, she gave the women's clothes and baubles, along with the silver ewers and beardless eunuchs; the spinster received the fields and the flocks, the country estate and farm hands, along with the cattle and draft animals and farming tools; and for the hard-drinking daughter there was a cellar filled with casks of vintage wine, an elegant house, and pleasant little gardens.

The ambassadors set out, but with no hasty steps, while snuffing with their nostrils for food in every filth. Being summoned, they fail to make their appearance. After some difficulty Mercury finds them at last, and brings them  up in confusion. As soon, however, as they saw the countenance of mighty Jove, in their fright they bewrayed the whole palace. Out they go, driven away with sticks; but great Jove forbade that they should be sent back. The Dogs, wondering that their Ambassadors did not return, and suspecting that they had committed something disgraceful, after a while ordered others to be appointed to aid them. Rumour soon betrayed the former Ambassadors. Dreading that something of a similar nature may happen a second time, they stuff the Dogs behind with perfumes, and plenty of them. They give their directions; the Ambassadors are dispatched; at once they take their departure. They beg for an audience, and forthwith obtain it. Then did the most mighty Father of the Gods take his seat on his throne, and brandish his thunders; all things began to shake. The Dogs in alarm, so sudden was the crash, in a moment let fall the perfumes with their dung. All cry out, that the affront must be avenged. But before proceeding to punishment, thus spoke Jupiter:- 'It is not for a King to send Ambassadors away, nor is it a difficult matter to inflict a proper punishment on the offence; but by way of judgment this is the reward you shall have. I don't forbid their return, but they shall be famished with hunger, lest they be not able to keep their stomachs in order. And as for those who sent such despicable Ambassadors as you, they shall never be free from the insults of man.' And so it is, that even now the Dogs of the present day are in expectation of their Ambassadors. When one of them sees a strange Dog appear, he snuffs at his tail.",

The ambassadors set out, but with no hasty steps, while snuffing with their nostrils for food in every filth. Being summoned, they fail to make their appearance. After some difficulty Mercury finds them at last, and brings them  up in confusion. As soon, however, as they saw the countenance of mighty Jove, in their fright they bewrayed the whole palace. Out they go, driven away with sticks; but great Jove forbade that they should be sent back. The Dogs, wondering that their Ambassadors did not return, and suspecting that they had committed something disgraceful, after a while ordered others to be appointed to aid them. Rumour soon betrayed the former Ambassadors. Dreading that something of a similar nature may happen a second time, they stuff the Dogs behind with perfumes, and plenty of them. They give their directions; the Ambassadors are dispatched; at once they take their departure. They beg for an audience, and forthwith obtain it. Then did the most mighty Father of the Gods take his seat on his throne, and brandish his thunders; all things began to shake. The Dogs in alarm, so sudden was the crash, in a moment let fall the perfumes with their dung. All cry out, that the affront must be avenged. But before proceeding to punishment, thus spoke Jupiter:- 'It is not for a King to send Ambassadors away, nor is it a difficult matter to inflict a proper punishment on the offence; but by way of judgment this is the reward you shall have. I don't forbid their return, but they shall be famished with hunger, lest they be not able to keep their stomachs in order. And as for those who sent such despicable Ambassadors as you, they shall never be free from the insults of man.' And so it is, that even now the Dogs of the present day are in expectation of their Ambassadors. When one of them sees a strange Dog appear, he snuffs at his tail."

Jupiter in heaven laughs to himself, no doubt, he who, in his mighty plan, denied these qualities to men, lest our audacity should wrest from him the sceptre of the world.

The ox was making a great effort, even though he had an injury to his horn, while the donkey was doing nothing to help. As the ox struggled to pull the load by himself, he soon died. The driver then loaded the ox's carcass upon the donkey and began beating him mercilessly. The donkey broke down and collapsed under the weight, dropping dead in the middle of the road. A flock of birds flew up and alighted on the donkey's carcass. 'If only you had been kind enough to help the ox pull the load,' they said, 'you would not have died this untimely death, with carrion birds feasting on your flesh.'"

        "response": "Flattery and deceit can lead even the wisest to their downfall.",
        "original": "Story: There was a lion who had fallen ill and was lying in a stony ravine, his sluggish limbs stretched out upon the ground. A friendly fox kept him company, and one day the lion said to her, 'I suppose you want me to survive, so listen: I've got a craving for the deer who lives in that dense thicket of pines there in the wilds of the forest. At the moment I no longer have the strength to go hunting after deer myself, but if you would agree to lay a trap with that honeyed speech of yours, the deer could be within my grasp.' The sly fox went off and found the deer in the wild woodlands, gambolling in a meadow of tender grass. The fox prostrated herself before the deer and greeted her, saying that she had come to relay some auspicious information. 'As you know,' the fox said, 'the lion is my neighbour, but he is very sick and about to die, so he has been thinking about who will be king of the beasts after he is gone. The boar is an idiot, the bear is lazy, the leopard is impulsive, the tiger is a loner who keeps to himself... but he thinks that the deer would make a most worthy ruler, since she has an impressive appearance and lives a long time. And the antlers of the deer can scare away all kinds of snakes, why, the antlers of the deer are like trees, not at all like the horns of a bull! Need I say more? You have been duly elected: you will rule over the beasts of the hills. When that finally happens, O Mistress, remember that it was the fox who was the first to inform you. That is why I came here, and now good-bye, my dear. I need to hurry back to the lion so that he won't be looking for me again; he relies on my advice in absolutely everything. And I think it would be good if you also obeyed that venerable old head. You need to come to his bedside and comfort him in his trouble. Even little things can sway the thoughts of those who are in the last hours of life; the souls of the dying can be seen in their eyes.' This is what the sly fox said to the deer, and the deer's heart swelled at the sound of those deceitful words. She came to the hollow cave of the beast, with no idea of what lay in store for her. The lion recklessly sprang up from his bed and launched a hasty attack, but he only managed to slash the deer's ears with his pointed claws as the wretched creature ran straight out the door and disappeared into the depths of the woods. The fox wrung her hands in frustration, since her efforts had proved utterly futile. As for the lion, he groaned and chewed at thin air, equally beset by both hunger and despair. Once again he summoned the fox and asked her to find yet another trick to use to catch the deer. The fox plumbed the very depths of her cunning and then said, 'This is a difficult task indeed. But nevertheless I will carry out your command!' The fox then set off after the deer, keen as a hound on the trail, devising elaborate traps and all kinds of mischief. Whenever she ran into a shepherd, the fox would ask if he had happened to see a bleeding deer on the run. And when the shepherd had indeed caught a glimpse of the deer, he would point the fox in the right direction. She finally found the deer concealed in the shade, where she had stopped to catch her breath. The fox stood and stared at the deer, eyebrows raised, the very incarnation of shamelessness. A shiver ran down the deer's spine and her legs quivered as she angrily said to the fox, 'Oh you abominable creature! If you dare to come near me or utter so much as a single word, you will live to regret it! Go find some other simpletons that you can outfox; pick someone else to be king and put him on the throne!' But the fox was undaunted and said to the deer, 'Can you really be so mean spirited? So overcome by fear? So suspicious of your friends? The lion only wanted what was good for you! In an attempt to rouse you from your former idleness, he tugged at your ear, as a father might do on his deathbed. He wanted to bestow on you every precept you would need in order to take charge of such a kingdom, but you could not even withstand the touch of his feeble hand! Instead, you violently turned aside, inflicting a serious wound on yourself. As for the lion, at this moment he is even more upset than you are. Now that he has found you to be so untrustworthy and scatter-brained, he says that the wolf will be appointed king. Alas alack, what a wicked master he will be! What shall I do then? You are the one who has brought these evils upon all of us. But come, you must be more brave in the future and not let yourself be as easily frightened as some sheep from the flock. I swear these things to you by all the leaves on the trees and by every spring of water: I want to serve you and only you! There is nothing hostile about the lion's behaviour; his heartfelt wish is to make you queen of all the animals!' With these coaxing words, the fox persuaded the tawny deer to enter once again into that very abode of death. As soon as the lion had the deer trapped in the depths of his den, he enjoyed a full course meal, greedily devouring the flesh of the deer, drinking the marrow from her bones and feasting on her entrails. The fox, meanwhile, stood there waiting; after having delivered the deer, she was craving a share in the spoils. She stealthily grabbed the brains of the deer which had fallen to the ground and gobbled them up: this, then, was the booty which that sly boots got for her work. The lion, meanwhile, had made an inventory of all the deer's parts, and the brains were nowhere to be found. He searched around his couch and all over the house. Then the fox confounded the truth of the matter and said, 'That deer had no brains, so don't waste your time looking for them. What kind of brains do you expect from a creature who would come not once but twice into the den of a lion?'",

                "content": "Story: There was a lion who had fallen ill and was lying in a stony ravine, his sluggish limbs stretched out upon the ground. A friendly fox kept him company, and one day the lion said to her, 'I suppose you want me to survive, so listen: I've got a craving for the deer who lives in that dense thicket of pines there in the wilds of the forest. At the moment I no longer have the strength to go hunting after deer myself, but if you would agree to lay a trap with that honeyed speech of yours, the deer could be within my grasp.' The sly fox went off and found the deer in the wild woodlands, gambolling in a meadow of tender grass. The fox prostrated herself before the deer and greeted her, saying that she had come to relay some auspicious information. 'As you know,' the fox said, 'the lion is my neighbour, but he is very sick and about to die, so he has been thinking about who will be king of the beasts after he is gone. The boar is an idiot, the bear is lazy, the leopard is impulsive, the tiger is a loner who keeps to himself... but he thinks that the deer would make a most worthy ruler, since she has an impressive appearance and lives a long time. And the antlers of the deer can scare away all kinds of snakes, why, the antlers of the deer are like trees, not at all like the horns of a bull! Need I say more? You have been duly elected: you will rule over the beasts of the hills. When that finally happens, O Mistress, remember that it was the fox who was the first to inform you. That is why I came here, and now good-bye, my dear. I need to hurry back to the lion so that he won't be looking for me again; he relies on my advice in absolutely everything. And I think it would be good if you also obeyed that venerable old head. You need to come to his bedside and comfort him in his trouble. Even little things can sway the thoughts of those who are in the last hours of life; the souls of the dying can be seen in their eyes.' This is what the sly fox said to the deer, and the deer's heart swelled at the sound of those deceitful words. She came to the hollow cave of the beast, with no idea of what lay in store for her. The lion recklessly sprang up from his bed and launched a hasty attack, but he only managed to slash the deer's ears with his pointed claws as the wretched creature ran straight out the door and disappeared into the depths of the woods. The fox wrung her hands in frustration, since her efforts had proved utterly futile. As for the lion, he groaned and chewed at thin air, equally beset by both hunger and despair. Once again he summoned the fox and asked her to find yet another trick to use to catch the deer. The fox plumbed the very depths of her cunning and then said, 'This is a difficult task indeed. But nevertheless I will carry out your command!' The fox then set off after the deer, keen as a hound on the trail, devising elaborate traps and all kinds of mischief. Whenever she ran into a shepherd, the fox would ask if he had happened to see a bleeding deer on the run. And when the shepherd had indeed caught a glimpse of the deer, he would point the fox in the right direction. She finally found the deer concealed in the shade, where she had stopped to catch her breath. The fox stood and stared at the deer, eyebrows raised, the very incarnation of shamelessness. A shiver ran down the deer's spine and her legs quivered as she angrily said to the fox, 'Oh you abominable creature!

Prometheus made the way of freedom rough at the beginning, impassable and steep, with no water anywhere to drink, full of brambles, and beset with dangers on all sides at first. Eventually, however, it became a smooth plain, lined with paths and filled with groves of fruit trees and waterways. Thus the distressing experience ended in repose for those who breath the air of freedom. The way of slavery, however, started out as a smooth plain at the beginning, full of flowers, pleasant to look at and quite luxurious, but in the end it became impassable, steep and insurmountable on all sides."

It's not as if there were not plenty of food for me here in the field -- grasshoppers, beetles, locusts in abundance -- so there's nothing for you to be afraid of. I am actually very fond of you because of your retiring manner and honest ways.' The singing bird replied, 'Your words are certainly pleasant to hear, but I am no equal to you on the ground.

Completely tired of spring, in which season he had to endure so much hard work, he was asking in all his prayers for summer to come, so that his master would be busy with the harvest and they would allow him to rest. But then too, when he was compelled to carry the harvest to the threshing-floor and from there to carry the wheat into the house, and there was not place of rest for him, the donkey was hoping that at least autumn would be an end of his labors. But not even at that time did the donkey see an end of his troubles, since every day there was wood, apples and wine to be carried, so again he begged for the snow and ice of winter, so that at least there would be some rest allotted to him from so much hard work.",

Therefore, he was hoping for the moderation of spring and its tender grasses. But when spring came, he was compelled by his master (who was a potter) to carry the clay into the work area, to carry wood for the oven, and from there to carry the bricks, tiles and roof-tiles to various places. Completely tired of spring, in which season he had to endure so much hard work, he was asking in all his prayers for summer to come, so that his master would be busy with the harvest and they would allow him to rest. But then too, when he was compelled to carry the harvest to the threshing-floor and from there to carry the wheat into the house, and there was not place of rest for him, the donkey was hoping that at least autumn would be an end of his labors. But not even at that time did the donkey see an end of his troubles, since every day there was wood, apples and wine to be carried, so again he begged for the snow and ice of winter, so that at least there would be some rest allotted to him from so much hard work."

So when he was enjoying some sunny place, warming himself by the sun's heat, it happened that some hunters, who had been chasing a wolf, came that way. When the young man asked them why they hadn't caught the wolf, they replied, 'We were not able to pursue him because of his incredible swiftness.'
